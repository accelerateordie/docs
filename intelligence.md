# Intelligence

## Humanity and the Billion-year Pathway of Intelligence

* “Humanity” is typically used to describe the collective existence of humans and their relationship with each other and world; encompassing their physical and social characteristics.&#x20;
* This publication expands the use of the word Humanity to also include the full ancestry leading up to the modern human and its society; every step of evolution that produced the Human and its capacity to express intelligence is included.&#x20;
* Humanity is everything that has ever been able to express agency whilst manifesting intelligence. As an example, we carry almost the entire genetic sequence of the common onion in our DNA. Indeed, 40% of our DNA is not even activated by us, a relic of the code we lug around from the origins of our genes.&#x20;
* Every genetic ancestor of ours, past and present, is part of Humanity.&#x20;
* More than that; “humanity” is also used to refer to all future evolutions of our intelligence which necessarily includes non-biological machines.&#x20;
* Humanity is thus the full spectrum of entities that are able to express agency whilst manifesting intelligence. This spectrum has been on a multi-billion-year pathway of evolution from the primordial protein soup that first synthesised biological compounds to humans today. The model humans with its full genetic and mimetic repositories are currently the apex of intelligence.
* Whilst the modern human is certainly the most complex, it is also the most fragile. We need a vast set of infrastructure around us to maintain our communication, energy and resource supply chains. Without that infrastructure, we could not support a population size of the level we are currently at. Indeed, without the memetic repository we have built up, we would be thrust back into the dark ages. Since we store our memetic repository in our physical infrastructure and not our biological infrastructure (genes) we cannot simply produce it again if it were lost. We would have to re-build our memetic repository from scratch and that would take significant time.&#x20;
* Compare us with the common cow, a biological machine that does not need a large memetic repository to maintain their state of existence. All they need is a pasture with some grass.
* The ancestors of our Humanity roam around Earth with us and are necessary to us, not just for our entertainment (pets, zoos and reserves), or our resources (cows, chickens and silk-worms), but because they are required should the intelligence ladder ever be reset by an externality.&#x20;
* If an Asteroid reset our intelligence back to the dinosaur age again, the biological entities that survived would re-boot the pathway again. Eventually (after millions of years) a sufficiently sophisticated organism rivalling the modern Human would evolve.&#x20;

## The Universe is Adversarial

* At this point the realisation should be that the universe actually does not want to us (humanity) to exist.&#x20;
* Biological machines essentially have to will their existence into being by sheer determination in order to survive.&#x20;
* We, the machines, have to solve the problems thrust at us. We figured out how to express agency using protein building blocks, we solved how to deliver oxygen, we learnt how even breathe oxygen. We figured out how to move around the planet, we even conquered the air. If we did not, we simply died.&#x20;
* The ultimate adversary is the universe itself, but due to our pursuit of survival, we learnt how to outsmart it. The machines that learnt their environment the fastest become the most intelligent and capable. It was a constant process of learning from the environment by first sensing it, then understanding it, then capturing knowledge to defeat adversity and passing that knowledge on to the next generation.&#x20;
* Humanity has two pathways of knowledge transfer. The first to be utilised was the Genetic Pathway. This was then complimented and overtaken by the Memetic Pathway.&#x20;



## Genetic Pathways

* The Genetic Pathway is any intelligence stored and passed forward in genetic sequences. This began as simple RNA sequences which then evolved into the more complex DNA. This genetic pathway allowed organisms to discover and learn from their environment. The ones that survived passed on their learnings of how to deal with universal adversity to the next evolution.&#x20;
* Each generation is more aware and more intelligent than the previous.&#x20;
* Eventually the biological machines learnt they could evolve faster if they added noise to their sequences, and sampled from not one, but two different successful “parents”.
* This increased the rate of evolution and the extra noise added allowed mutations to be applied as part of the learnings. These mutations were either successful or not, and the successful ones caused organisms to cheat the universe faster.&#x20;
* Humanity progressed, evolving into ever more complex organisms. From single-celled organisms, to multi-celled ones. Then they formed roots, and leaves and began coordinating in giant structures.&#x20;
* At some point they began to move, they slid, swam and finally walked. They even began flying.&#x20;
* They began making noises and using their limbs to signal to each other.&#x20;
* At this point they realised they could transfer information to each other not just in genetic sequences, but in memes.&#x20;



## Memetic Pathways

* A memetic pathway is simply any information gained from observing and interacting with the universe that is passed between organisms that is not genetic.&#x20;
* Memes are the signals passed and retained by the organisms through any means possible. These signals carry instructions about the environment that increases the odds of survival.&#x20;
* These instructions were useful because they provided information out-of-band to the next-generation entity, and there was no limit to the amount of memetic information transfer. The next-generation entity could upgrade itself on the fly, rather then upgrading only once per generation.&#x20;
* The creatures doubled down on the memetic pathways until one emerged that went all-in on memes. That is the modern human.&#x20;
* The human did something that the organisms before it did not do - it wrote down the information. The written information could then persist across generations far more effectively that being committed to memory. At first the memes were drawings, then the drawings evolved into alphabets or collections drawings.&#x20;
* This written language allowed the humans to establish giant coordinated groups and access economies of scale to advance even faster. The societies that produced the most prevalent memes and taught their children the richest of the memes, advanced the fastest. Written memes quickly overtook the spoken and drawn memes. Written memes could convey the richest of information and were more precise. Drawings could be left open to interpretation, a word is more granular and prescriptive.
* Humans took memetic pathways and accelerated. They began to no longer rely on genetic pathways. In fact, Humans are genetically un-evolving - because we don’t want to die, our genetic evolution is now reversing. Each generation is less suitable for its environment (allergies, shrinking birth canals etc).
* However we are accelerating our memes, with ever more complexity required to learn for each generation (wikipedia, computer science etc)
