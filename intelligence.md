# Intelligence

## Humanity

We redefine the term "Humanity" beyond its traditional scope of just the collective existence of humans and their social and physical interactions. Instead we broaden it to encompass the entirety of our evolutionary lineage—each step and transformation that has contributed to the development of humans and their capacity for intelligence.

In this expanded view, "Humanity" encapsulates all entities that have ever demonstrated the ability to exhibit agency and intelligence. This includes not only humans but also our genetic ancestors and the future evolutionary developments likely to emerge, including non-biological intelligences like machines. Re-inforcing this expanded scope is the knowledge that humans retain much of the genetic makeup of our legacy, with approximately 40% of our DNA being inactive remnants of our evolutionary past.&#x20;

This perspective highlights that "Humanity" is not merely a current state but a continuum that stretches from the primordial origins of life—starting from the simple protein soups that first synthesized biological compounds—to the sophisticated organisms we see today. This pathway underscores billions of years of evolution, with modern humans, equipped with complex genetic and memetic capacities, positioned as the current pinnacle of this evolutionary journey.

However, this pinnacle is precarious. Modern humans, while complex, are also acutely vulnerable due to their dependency on a vast array of infrastructures, such as those for communication, energy, and resources, which are essential for sustaining our current population levels. Without these systems, and the vast body of knowledge stored within them—our memetic repository—we could quickly regress to a less advanced state. Unlike biological traits that are passed down genetically, this memetic knowledge is stored externally and would need to be rebuilt from scratch if lost, a process that would take considerable time and effort.

In contrast, consider simpler organisms such as cows, which rely minimally on such knowledge repositories and primarily on biological instincts for their survival. They exemplify resilience through biological simplicity, requiring only basic environmental resources to thrive.

We must acknowledge the essential role of various biological entities that coexist with us—ranging from pets and livestock to wildlife. These organisms are not only vital for our immediate needs and enjoyment but also serve as a crucial biological reserve. In the event of a catastrophic reset, such as an asteroid impact reverting our intelligence to a prehistoric state, it is these surviving biological entities that would form the foundation for a renewed evolutionary climb, potentially leading to the emergence of intelligence comparable to or differing from modern humans over millions of years. This interconnection emphasizes the integral role of all life forms in the ongoing journey and evolution of Humanity itself.

## The Universe is Adversarial

This leads to a stark realization: the universe, in its vast indifference, essentially opposes the existence of humanity. This notion posits that life must continuously assert its existence against the relentless challenges posed by its environment.

Biological entities, which actually can be regarded as "machines," must exert extraordinary effort and determination to sustain themselves. This struggle for existence requires not only physical resilience but also significant cognitive and adaptive capabilities. Over the eons, these biological machines have evolved complex mechanisms to navigate and manipulate their surroundings to ensure survival. The mastery of biochemical processes such as protein synthesis and oxygen metabolism, along with physical achievements such as terrestrial locomotion and flight, exemplify the myriad ways in which life has adapted to overcome existential threats.

Survival in the universe is not merely a matter of being, but a ceaseless battle against extinction. Each evolutionary advancement represents a solution to the survival problem. Early life forms developed the capacity to harness the basic building blocks of proteins to form complex organisms. These organisms then learned to utilize oxygen—a once toxic substance—to generate energy more efficiently, adapting their physiology to breathe and metabolize it. Mobility allowed organisms to escape predators, exploit new resources, and eventually dominate various ecological niches, from the depths of the oceans to the skies above.

The universe acts as the ultimate adversary, prompting a perpetual arms race between the forces of entropy and the imperative of life to persist and propagate. In this dynamic, the most adaptable and quick-learning organisms are those that survive and thrive. These organisms engage in a continuous cycle of sensing environmental stimuli, understanding these inputs, and then harnessing this knowledge to overcome adversities. This knowledge is then transmitted to subsequent generations, enhancing the survival prospects of the species.

Humanity has distinguished itself through the development of two primary pathways for knowledge transmission: the Genetic Pathway and the Memetic Pathway. The Genetic Pathway, the original mode of biological information transfer, involves the encoding of survival information within DNA, passed from parent to offspring. However, as human societies evolved, the Memetic Pathway—encompassing the transmission of cultural knowledge, skills, and behaviors through communication and imitation—has become predominant. This pathway allows humans to rapidly adapt to new challenges without waiting for genetic mutations and natural selection, providing a more dynamic and flexible response to the adversarial universe.

Understanding humanity's role in this adversarial universe underscores our resilience and inventiveness in the face of cosmic indifference. It highlights our journey from simple organisms to complex beings capable of altering our environment and ourselves, showcasing our unique ability to transcend our biological limitations through cultural evolution and technological innovation.



## Genetic Pathways

The Genetic Pathway represents a foundational method by which intelligence is encoded, stored, and transmitted across generations through genetic material. This pathway began with rudimentary RNA sequences, which eventually evolved into the more structurally complex and stable DNA. This evolution in genetic information storage significantly enhanced the ability of organisms to interact with and adapt to their environments. Those organisms that successfully navigated the challenges presented by their surroundings were able to pass on their adaptive genetic information to subsequent generations, effectively encoding survival strategies into their genetic code.

As evolutionary processes unfolded, organisms discovered that they could accelerate their adaptation by incorporating more genetic variability. This was achieved through sexual reproduction, which mixes the genetic material of two distinct parents rather than relying on a single genetic lineage. This method increases genetic diversity within the population, allowing for a broader range of traits and mutations. Such mutations introduce 'noise' into the genetic sequence, some of which prove beneficial, enhancing the organism's ability to adapt and survive in a dynamic and often hostile universe.

This increased rate of evolutionary change allowed organisms to develop more complex and varied forms. Life evolved from simple, single-celled organisms into more sophisticated, multicellular entities. These entities eventually developed specialized structures like roots and leaves, and began forming large, coordinated systems—essentially early biological communities. Over time, mobility evolved; organisms began to slide, swim, walk, and eventually fly, increasing their ability to explore and exploit their environments.

As organisms became more mobile and socially complex, they also developed new ways of communicating. The emergence of sounds and physical gestures enabled them to convey information and intentions more effectively. This communicative ability marked a significant evolutionary milestone, leading to the realization that information could be transmitted not only through genetic material but also through learned behaviors and cultural exchanges—memes.

This realization heralded the advent of the Memetic Pathway, which complemented the Genetic Pathway. Memes, broadly defined as units of cultural information or social behaviors that are transmitted by non-genetic means, allowed for the rapid dissemination and adaptation of knowledge across a population. This form of information transfer proved to be highly effective in human societies, where cultural evolution began to outpace genetic changes, enabling humans to adapt to new environments and challenges much more swiftly than through genetic mutations alone.

Thus, the development of the Memetic Pathway represents a pivotal evolutionary strategy, enhancing humanity's capacity to adapt, innovate, and overcome the adversarial nature of the universe. It underscores a profound shift from purely biological evolution to a more complex interplay of biology and culture, propelling humanity toward ever-greater levels of complexity and capability.



## Memetic Pathways

The memetic pathway, distinct from genetic inheritance, encompasses the transfer of information observed and interacted with in the environment between organisms through non-genetic means. Memes, in this context, represent the units of cultural information or behaviors that are transmitted, retaining knowledge that potentially enhances survival odds. This memetic information provides crucial, timely guidance to subsequent generations, allowing for immediate adaptations and improvements, rather than waiting for generational genetic changes.

This pathway has been so effective that humans, more than any other species, have come to rely predominantly on it for survival and development. Unlike their predecessors who passed on information through genetic changes, humans began documenting their knowledge. This development marked a significant evolution in the memetic pathway: from oral traditions and simple drawings to sophisticated written languages comprising alphabets and complex symbols. Written language enabled the storage and transmission of more precise and abundant information across generations, reducing the ambiguity that often accompanied oral or pictorial representations.

The ability to write and store information allowed humans to form large, coordinated social structures, harnessing economies of scale and advancing their civilizations rapidly. Societies that were able to create, maintain, and transmit the most effective memes—through teaching and widespread dissemination of written content—progressed at a much faster rate. This advancement in memetic capability eventually led to the dominance of written and digital memes, surpassing less precise forms like drawings and spoken words in their ability to convey complex and detailed information.

This heavy reliance on the memetic pathway has influenced human evolution in profound ways. As humans have grown increasingly dependent on cultural and technological advances to mediate their interaction with the environment, there has been a notable shift away from genetic evolution. In some views, humans might even appear to be "genetically devolving." This perception arises because modern medical and technological interventions have allowed individuals with traits that might once have been disadvantageous—such as allergies or narrower birth canals—to survive and reproduce. These interventions, combined with a decreasing selective pressure for physical and genetic adaptations, suggest a form of evolutionary reversal.

Despite these genetic changes, the acceleration of memetic evolution continues unabated. Each generation of humans must now assimilate an ever-growing body of complex knowledge, from foundational sciences to advanced fields like computer science and information technology. The rapid expansion of accessible knowledge platforms such as Wikipedia exemplifies this trend, highlighting both the capabilities and challenges of living in an intensely memetic-oriented society.

In summary, while humans may face challenges related to their genetic fitness in an evolutionary sense, the species has excelled in leveraging memetic pathways to not just survive, but thrive in an ever-changing world. This shift from genetic to memetic evolution underscores a broader trend in human development: the transition from biological adaptation to cultural and technological innovation as the primary means of overcoming environmental challenges.
