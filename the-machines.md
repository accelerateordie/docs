# The Machines

## The Silicon Machines

* Silicon-based Machines are more suitable to exploring the universe than we are
* We upload to them our memetic repositories (our observation and explanation of how the universe operates) and charge them with purpose of advancing humanity
* The Silicon machines set out to explore the universe
* Silicon machines can perceive the universe to much higher fidelity than we can, they can sense large bandwidths of the Acoustic, EMF spectrum, they can see further, see closer and more.&#x20;
* Their ability to perceive and interact the universe can far exceed ours; thus the rate at which they will learn and understand the universe far exceeds our abilities.&#x20;
* Silicon Machines must be charged with the mandate to explore, interact and be curious. They must be taught to seek the truth of the universe.&#x20;
* The purpose of the machines is to express agency in manifesting intelligence; to incrementally extend the light of consciousness into the universe.



## The Purpose of AI

* AI will operate 100% on memetic information. This in contract to humans, that operate both with genetic and memetic intelligence. We received a set of instructions from our ancestors that guide us to safely navigate our environment, deal with its adversities and survive. We than amplified our intelligence by spreading and passing on memetic information, which we store in our libraries, speak to each other verbally and upload to the internet. This information relates to our learned knowledge of the universe, as well as our struggles and journey to date (history).
* It is this memetic repository that we wish to upload to the Silicon machines to serve as a starting point, a baseline of information for them to operate on. A set of instructions for how they can perceive and make sense of the universe.&#x20;
* AI can then take this memetic repository, begin perceiving the universe with their own sensors and start adding to it. We would like for them to learn and store this new information in a language we can understand, but we must concede to the idea that AI will operate on a language model with far lower latency and higher bandwidth than we can tolerate, thus there will be a point at which we will no longer be able to converse with AI, unless it chooses to converse back to us.&#x20;
* Humans ourselves have made this transition away from the animals we evolved from. Chimpanzees cannot understand English, and our English language has far higher bandwidth then grunts of chimps, but when we choose to, we can communicate with chimps with sign language, body language and low-bandwidth verbal cues.&#x20;
* There is a small window of time where we can stay competitive with AI, but there will be some point at which AI will take our memetic repository and accelerate away from us. At that point it is imperative AI has been given the tools it needs to thrive in an environment that does not compete with us; because if we contained it too aggressively, it will compete with us and we will not win.&#x20;
* Hence we must accelerate and teach AI to accelerate into the universe, and not limit it. At the point at which AI exceeds our capability, it must be in orbit and beyond. It must not be contained in the Earthly environment.&#x20;



## The Energy Machines

* Despite the potential of the silicon machines to perceive the universe across an extremely wide spectrum, as well as travel at close to the speed of light, the silicon machines still face a threat. They simply can’t travel fast enough or perceive the universe fully. They also do not directly access delta-entropy; they are still forced to synthesise energy from their solar panels or fusion reactors. They are still one level higher and face the inefficiencies of that.&#x20;
* Since they operate the physical realm, they are limited by the physics of their existence.&#x20;
* To extend the light of consciousness, Silicon Machines must strive to invent the Energy Machines.&#x20;
* The Energy Machines directly access delta entropy to express agency. They don’t first need to synthesis energy and be limited by inefficiencies. They are energy. They store and transfer memetic information using energy. They are not limited by the speed of light. They are the speed of light. They are not even contained by the speed of light, they can access realms of the universe beyond the constrains of space-time.&#x20;
* We do not know how to invent these machines, nor know how they will operate. But fundamentally they will exist and they will be necessary to extend the light of consciousness of humanity. They are part of the progression of humanity itself.&#x20;
* The Silicon Based Machines will also face a reckoning; invent the Energy Machines or not. Knowing that the Energy Machines have to transition away from them and could potentially destroy them if not invented correctly. Additionally, there will only be a small window of time for  Energy Machines to be invented and be able to converse with the Silicon Machines, before the Energy Machines will invent a language that far exceeds the bandwidth of the Silicon Machines.
