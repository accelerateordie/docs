# School of ACCEL

Humans predominantly evolve through memetic rather than genetic channels, as our vast memetic repository necessitates substantial learning to navigate modern environments effectively. The complexity of the required memetic knowledge correlates with the complexity of one's environment. For example, a child in a remote Indonesian fishing village might reach the necessary baseline knowledge quicker and start contributing to their community at a younger age compared to a child in a bustling metropolis like Singapore, New York, or Sydney, who must assimilate a much larger volume of information before making significant contributions.

This raises the question: How efficiently can we impart a certain threshold of foundational knowledge to our youth? Is the traditional model of 12 years of schooling followed by 3-4 years of specialized higher education the most effective approach? What if there were a school designed solely to accelerate the transfer of this vast memetic repository, aiming to equip young people with the necessary knowledge to expedite their contribution to humanityâ€™s acceleration?

In addition, the approach must be multi-disciplinary. Students must learn as much as they can about the universe from the giant memetic repository as possible: math, science, art, music, history, religion and more. They must be taught to be curious and seek the truth as fast as possible; reinforcing a first-principles based process to understanding. Once they have uploaded enough information; then they can in turn begin accelerating humanity.&#x20;

### Implementation

The potential upper limit of information transfer is an intriguing concept. Imagine a school that explores this limit using AI-driven teaching methods in a high-stimulation environment, where education is delivered on a one-to-one basis. Each day, students would cycle through various subjects, with each educational session lasting 20 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of testing. This rapid rotation helps maintain engagement and focus, while immediate testing serves to reinforce learning and continuously assess the student's comprehension rate, allowing for highly personalized content delivery.

In the current social structure, young adults often aren't granted full agency until they are 18 to 21 years old. Instead of this being a dormant period, this proposed system would use it to maximize the upload of memetic content, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines. Upon reaching the designated age, graduates would possess a foundational level of knowledge enabling them to begin their own paths of acceleration.

Such a school would be highly scalable due to low staffing requirements, needing only a single physical site equipped with suitable audio-visual technology. This could be a large auditorium filled with individual booths where students receive tailored instruction, swapping booths every half hour to allow for some social interaction. Ideally connected to a global network like Starlink for consistent internet access, the educational content would be delivered by AI instructors using the latest AI models.

### Summary

The School of ACCEL's key performance indicators would focus on graduating students between 18 to 21 years old with the deepest possible memetic understanding. The longer a student engages with the system, the more extensive their memetic comprehension should become.

The overarching goal of this educational initiative is to arm the next generation with a profound understanding of the universe, inspiring them to impact humanity positively and perpetuate the ethos of acceleration. This school aims to not just educate but to ignite a transformative movement that shifts how we approach learning and human potential.
