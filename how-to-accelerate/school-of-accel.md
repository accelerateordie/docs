# School of ACCEL

* Humans operate 99% on memetic evolution; our genetic evolution pathway is no longer necessary.&#x20;
* Our memetic repository is vast, and there is a minimum amount of that repository that must be uploaded to our brains as we grow up to safely navigate our modern environment.
* The complexity of that memetic repository scales with the complexity of our environment. A child in a remote Indonesian fishing village can achieve the minimum far faster and can contribute back to their village at a much earlier age.
* A child in a modern complex city such as Singapore, New York or Sydney must learn a significant amount more, thus is not able to contribute meaningfully back to their environment until a higher age.&#x20;
* The memetic repository is extremely diverse, there is not one important aspect to it; from math to science, from history to music, from art to articulation.&#x20;
* The question remains; how fast is it possible to upload the baseline of information to our younger generation? Is 12 years of school necessary, with 3-4 years of higher education on a single subject?
* What is possible when a school is created with a single purpose to accelerate the rate of delivery of as much of that memetic repository as possible, with the vision to equipping our younger generation with the baseline of knowledge so they can begin accelerating humanity faster?
* What is the upper bound of information transfer? \

* One such education system would be a school that simply seeks to answer this question. The school would use AI-enhanced delivery systems in a high-stimulation environment and the delivery would be 1-1.&#x20;
* The child would enter the system every day, and be guided on a rotating field of education. The bouts of delivery would be short; 20mins of high-stimulation delivery, 10mins of testing, then move on. A fast rotation of subject matter would ensure the child stays engaged and doesn’t drop off in focus.&#x20;
* Fast and immediate testing serves two purposes; one to train the uptake of the information, and the second to pulse-check the progress of the child’s uptake. This would allow extremely personalised content delivery at the rate the child has demonstrated to operate at.
* The modern social structure we live in doesn’t give young adults much agency until a minimum of 18 to 21. This time would not be wasted, instead the memetic upload system would continue to upload as much of the memetic repository as possible, covering vast fields across art, music, science, engineering, and more.&#x20;
* The graduation of the child at the designated age would mark them as having achieved the minimum level of knowledge where they can now embark into the world and begin their own journey of accelerating.&#x20;
* Such a school would be extremely scalable because staffing needs are low. It simply needs a single physical location where the delivery can be comfortably made with the appropriate audio-visual equipment.&#x20;
* It would be connected to the internet (such as Starlink, anywhere in the world) and the delivery would be made by AI teachers, connected to the latest generative or transformer model.&#x20;
* The actual physical implementation of the school would be a large auditorium connected with many booths. Children would enter and exit the booths to receive their personalised delivery and every 30 mins swap booths via the large auditorium where an amount of socialising can occur.&#x20;
* I will launch an ACCEL school as soon as possible, in any jurisdiction willing to accept my proposal.&#x20;
* The KPIs of the school is to graduate students as fast as possible in the 18-21 range with the highest possible memetic understanding.&#x20;
* The longer a student participates in the school, the larger their memetic understanding should be.&#x20;
* The purpose of the school is to equip the younger generation with as much understanding of the universe as possible, them charge them with the inspiration to change humanity. To move the needle on humanity in any way possible. To promote the idea of accelerating and spread it.&#x20;
