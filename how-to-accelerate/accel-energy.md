# ACCEL Energy

Humanity, along with all other living organisms, requires food, water, oxygen, and energy to survive and express agency. On Earth, these resources are organically provided by our environment, leading to competition among humans, plants, and animals. However, this competitive dynamic is not an inevitability. The resources we depend on are essentially specific arrangements of atoms synthesized by organic processes. Plants produce oxygen, water cycles from our oceans to our lands, food is created through various biological syntheses, and the sun furnishes the energy that powers these processes.

By harnessing innovation and our access to energy, we can address resource supply issues and transition to a post-scarcity society. This is not only crucial for our sustainable settlement on Mars, where we must synthesize all essential resources from scratch, but also for improving conditions back on Earth. By developing the necessary technologies for Mars, we could revolutionize how we manage resources on Earth, eliminating scarcity and competition for resources.

Once we achieve this, we can transform our relationship with Earth from a parasitical to a guardian one, where we provide for the planet rather than pillage it. For example, vast regions like much of Australia and the Middle East are uninhabited due to natural limitations on water availability. Historically, these areas were more hospitable—as evidenced by Australia’s ancient inland sea and the Middle East’s significant oil deposits, which are remnants of rich biological pasts. With determination, we could develop technologies to redirect or produce moisture to these arid interiors, making them habitable.

Such technologies could include nuclear-powered sites driving massive pumps to create inland seas, or systems that extract moisture from air as it passes over deserts. These innovations would not only make new lands livable but also reflect our capability to fundamentally alter environments for human habitation. In addition - we could easily provide for a vast increase in biological diversity of the organisms around us. We could increase biological diversity and density by 1000x, bringing back organisms from our past, creating vast land, sea and ocean reserves to cater for these organisms.&#x20;

Regarding energy, humanity’s progress has always been tied to increasing our access to energy. From synthesizing sugars and discovering fire, which extended our day and improved our food storage, to utilizing dense energy sources like whale oil and then petroleum, each advancement has expanded our capabilities and accelerated our development. Nuclear energy, with its vast superiority in density and potential for safe management through innovation, represents the next step in this progression. The move towards nuclear fusion offers an even more promising horizon, with the potential for an evenly distributed energy source synthesized from almost any location with the right technology.

The pursuit of energy is not just a matter of necessity but a moral imperative to maximize our agency in the universe, which continues its entropic trajectory regardless of human action. The vast energy potential of the universe should be seen not as finite but as accessible through our expanding understanding and technology.

In conclusion, the concept of scarcity is largely artificial and self-imposed. With the right technological advancements and societal willpower, we can and should strive for a post-scarcity world where the limits we face today are transcended, allowing all of humanity to thrive without the constraints of resource competition.
