# Accelerate Or Die - the book

The initial step that can be taken is to encapsulate the essence of the movement in a single volume; this book. The aim is to articulate the principles of Accelerationism with precision and depth, preserving them in written form. Importantly - the book or its authors does not own the Acceleration movement, nor claim credit for it. It is merely observing and attempting to define it in the most approachable and encompassing means possible.

The publication should be crowd-sourced and crowd-edited. There is no single purpose who can adequately observe the entire movement fully - rather it is a distributed approach.&#x20;

Each year, the book should be updated in a new edition to ensure it remains a dynamic, evolving document that reflects the current state of the movement. This book is intended to be a guiding beacon for Accelerationism, representing a vast perspective.

The book will be marketed broadly and priced only high enough to sustain its production and promotion. Every sale will be reinvested into further publishing and distributing the book, ensuring it reaches as wide an audience as possible. The publication process will be swift to keep pace with the evolving nature of Accelerationism, with ongoing revisions informed by community feedback and new developments.
