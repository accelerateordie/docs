# This Publication

The initial step I can take is to encapsulate the essence of the movement in a single volume; this book. My aim is to articulate the principles of Accelerationism with precision and depth, preserving them in written form. Each year, I plan to revisit and update the book to ensure it remains a dynamic, evolving document that reflects the current state of the movement. This book is intended to be a guiding beacon for Accelerationism, representing my perspectiveâ€”just one among potentially many as I intend to incorporate insights from a broad spectrum of contributors within the movement.

The book will be marketed broadly and priced only high enough to sustain its production and promotion. Every sale will be reinvested into further publishing and distributing the book, ensuring it reaches as wide an audience as possible. The publication process will be swift to keep pace with the evolving nature of Accelerationism, with ongoing revisions informed by community feedback and new developments.
