# Accelerate or Die



* The first step I can take is to compose the full movement in one volume; this book.&#x20;
* To explain the movement in high detail, to capture it in written form. Then return each year and update it. This book should serve humanity as one long written snapshot of Accelerationism.&#x20;
* It is my perspective of Accelerating, in as much as it could be one perspective of the movement, it certainly is just one. And there should be many. I will seek to get the input from as many people from the movement as possible. This book should be the North Star of Acceleration.&#x20;
* The book should be marketed to and made available to as many people as possible, the price point of the book should only just be enough to fund itself and its promotion.&#x20;
* Every book sale should be reinvested back into its publication and distribution.&#x20;
* The book will be written and published as quickly as possible, then iterated with input.
