# ACCEL - The Brand

* The accelerationist movement is extremely young and is so far lacking a clear pronunciation of what it actually is
* The movement is vast and complex, the thought leaders in the space, whilst being extremely intelligent, tend to trip up on their explanations, they haven’t been able to “sell it” to the widest possible audience
* What is missing is a brand that can sell the movement to the public, that packages up the story in a discrete easy-to-digest way
* The brand must represent action, intelligence, progress, creativity, ingenuity, optimism. It must represent humanity itself.
* The brand must celebrate humanity’s achievements, humanity’s ability to explore and solve problems.&#x20;
* As such, it will begin life as an adventure-wear brand. It will make its debut to the world around events and campaigns that show how it can be used to explore and celebrate technology and progress.
* ACCEL will be grown into a marketing machine with a single purpose to promote the ACCEL vision. An analogue to it will be Red Bull - a brand that sells products around action and movement.&#x20;
* ACCEL will attempt to replicate Red Bull’s story, starting in merchandise, then growing into media and action-orientated products, and potentially including energy drinks. It may even own and operate a F1 team, the pinnacle of technology and engineering in a sport form.&#x20;
* ACCEL will not exist for its creators to enter a consumption do-loop. Its sole purpose is to sustainably sell and market the Accelerationist movement. Every acquisition of margin the brand achieves will be re-invested back into accelerating.&#x20;
* What is wild to me is the potential of the brand. It could be one of the largest brands in the world simply because of its DNA and purpose - that it is accelerating by promoting the accelerating movement.&#x20;
* I will set up the brand’s ownership in a way that it can be publicly owned. Anyone who subscribes to the vision of the brand and the movement and wishes to support, can either buy its product, or buy its equity.&#x20;
