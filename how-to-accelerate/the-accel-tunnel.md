# ACCEL Launch System

One fundamental requirement of accelerationism is the transfer of vast amounts of memetic and genetic information into orbit, driven by three primary motives. Firstly, to expand our intelligence beyond Earth, we need a method to physically launch intelligence and the resources necessary to support life on other planets and stars. Secondly, as we evolve alongside and perhaps integrate more closely with silicon machines, our dependency on Earth diminishes—our home planet, while crucial to our historical development, is not essential for our future in space. Lastly, confining silicon machines to Earth poses substantial risks due to their potential to misalign with human needs and consume resources excessively. Launching them into orbit becomes a safety imperative for both humanity and our biological brethren.

Addressing these needs requires a highly reusable launch system, fundamentally different from traditional rockets due to the inefficiencies and physical limitations they present. Rockets, which carry their own fuel, expend massive amounts of energy—typically, only 1% of a rocket's weight is payload. Alternative methods such as rail guns, although powerful, are unsuitable for biological payloads due to excessive acceleration forces and wear on the system.

### Implementation

The proposed solution is a kinetic launch system utilizing a coil gun mechanism within a vacuumed tunnel. This system would ideally be built into one of the world's high-altitude mountains, where thinner air above 25,000 feet reduces atmospheric drag, simplifying the launch process. Above 25k feet the air density is 60% less than sea level, representing a significant reduction in the problems to solve in the launch.&#x20;

The tunnel, approximately 80km long, would accelerate payloads to at least Mach 20 using a smooth acceleration curve that spans 10 seconds, making it survivable for biological payloads. Upon exiting the tunnel, an ablative nose shield would protect the payload from the intense energy transfer and atmospheric re-entry forces. The acceleration G-force is \~30G, lasting 10 seconds, whilst the momentatry deceleration force is \~30G, lasting 1-2 seconds before penetrating above 100k feet, and escaping the atmosphere.&#x20;

This coil gun system would operate in a vacuum-sealed tunnel, maintained by continuous vacuum pumps and use a hybrid mechanical-plasma shield at the tunnel's exit to seal the vacuum effectively. The expected operational cost for this system would be around $1 per kg to orbit, marking a 1000x cost reduction compared to traditional rocket launches. The tunnel would feature dual EMF fields; one for centering the payload to prevent contact with the tunnel walls, and another pulsing along the tunnel to propel the payload. The payload would have magnets at both ends to enhance the effect of the EMF fields. The front magnet would double as the ablative nose shield and both would be discarded moments after the launch. The payload would have a GPS and altitude-trigged deployment parachute should the launch fail for any reason, allowing easy recovery.&#x20;

Drilling the tunnel is simply a question of energy transfer - how to impart the maximum energy to the rock in the shortest period of time. The obvious answer to this is water-jet cutting from high-powered pumps (60k PSI and above) where the water is both lubricant and coolant - keeping the system below 100 degrees celsius. Of note the rock being drilled will likely be already sub-zero temperatures, so the water would also prevent freezing the bits. The drilled rock could also be ground back into cutting garnet and re-used in-situ. The drilled rock would fall down the tunnel, so tunnel-clearance would likely be easy. The drill rig would lay the tunnel casing as it pushed against it upwards. The drill rig would exit the top the tunnel.&#x20;

The tunnel's EMF propulsion is provided by large super-capaciters held along the tunnel, with robotic servicing. The payload's acceleration is either fire-and-forget or in-launch calibrated. The fire-and-forget model relies on an extremely accurate mathematical model of the tunnel, capaciters, temperature gradients and more, and then iteratively launches payloads until the perfect timing sequence is arrived at to launch the payloads at constant G. The pulsing EMF must be perfectly timed to push-pull the payload with minimal losses. The second approach uses a payload-position sensor to detect approach and fine-tune the EMF pulse to perfectly follow the launch. This would likely use lasers, mirrors and photorecepters in some mix, where the payload's position is sensed accurately.&#x20;

### Roll out

Considering the potential local economic benefits, the main challenge lies in gaining approval and navigating around opposition from the agencies who may resist such an idea. The most suitable location for such a tunnel is the Himalayas, given their east-west orientation and the height required for optimal launch conditions. Other locations are Inda, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Alaska.&#x20;

The plan is to progressively build this tunnel, starting with smaller segments—a 100m prototype, followed by 1km and then 10km sections, each increasing the engineering complexity by a factor of ten. This iterative development aims to refine the technology to achieve the final goal of launching payloads at Mach 20 over an 80km distance.

### Summary

Given that the necessary technology already exists, the real challenges lie in material science and energy transfer optimizations, which are solvable with targeted research and development. The feasibility of such a tunnel today, coupled with potential future advancements in related technologies, makes it a compelling project not just for accelerating human capabilities but for fundamentally reshaping our approach to space exploration and resource management.
