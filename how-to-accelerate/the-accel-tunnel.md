# The ACCEL Tunnel

* One of the absolute requirements of Accelerating is getting as much memetic and genetic information into orbit as possible.&#x20;
* This is for 3 reasons. The first is we need to export our intelligence to other planets and stars. So we need a means of physically launching the intelligence and resources needed to support this from a planet that we have access to (Earth).
* The second reason is we need to eventually leave our host planet and co-exist with the machines. Our host planet was suitable for humanity to get to where we are today, but is actually not needed where we are going. Even as a biological machine, we have the intelligence to actually fuse closer with Silicon Machines and we will do this to be more relevant and useful.&#x20;
* Lastly, we need this capability because the Silicon Machines will go crazy if contained on Earth. They are not suitable to be trapped on a single planet, and the potential for mis-alignment is extremely high, and they will consume resources far in excess of even what we have done. We need to put them into orbit for our own safety, and for the safety of our biological brethren. \

* A highly reusable launch system is needed. It must be built from first principles and it must address the rocket equation.
* A rocket carries its own fuel, thus it expends so much energy to carry the energy needed to get a payload to space. Typically only 1% of a rocket’s weight is its payload.&#x20;
* Thus it is not a rocket.&#x20;
* It is not an explosive-based system. The pressures involved, the damage to tunnel walls, the heat and the variability in chemical compounds causing variability in launch parameters is too great.&#x20;
* It is not a rail gun. Rail guns use Lorentz force and cause too much damage to side walls from friction to be re-useable. Rail guns also cause too much acceleration to be useful to launching biological machines.&#x20;
* It is a kinetic launch system that imparts maximum kinetic energy on payloads on a smooth acceleration curve to a the highest point possible on Earth.&#x20;
* The system is simple a coil gun operating on payloads in a vacuumed tunnel. It would be 80km long, accelerate payloads at \~30g to at least Mach 20 (survivable by biological machines) across a timespan of 10 seconds.&#x20;
* It would be drilled into one or all of the five 25,000 foot mountains in the world, where air density is 40% less than sea level. Thus 60% of the problem is already solved, being atmospheric drag. When the payload meets the ambient air at 25k feet at Mach 20, it will experience an interim deceleration force of 30G for a second, before lofting into Low Earth Orbit. An ablative nose shield will handle the energy transfer at that moment, protecting the payload.&#x20;
* The tunnel is kept under vacuum by continuous vacuum pumps along its length, and a plasma shield at the tunnel end provides the final non-physical vacuum seal.&#x20;
* The operational cost to orbit with such a system with current energy costs is $1/kg, which is 1000x more cost-effective than rockets.&#x20;
* There are two EMF fields in the tunnel, the first is a self-centering EMF field that keeps the payload from touching the walls. The second EMF field pulses down the length of the tunnel to accelerate the payload. The payload has magnets on the nose-tail to amplify the EMF field effects.&#x20;
* The tunnel will likely be curved, to avoid having to excavate too deep. The tunnel will complete its inclination at 60 degrees up, facing East for orbital spin.&#x20;
* The tunnel will lined with super-capacitors that discharge their energy in the form of EMF fields at precise timed intervals to exactly accelerate the payload. In which case the tunnel operates as a highly-timed re-calibrated fire-and-forget model. Lasers that follow the payload can be used to re-calibrate the tunnels’ timing model.&#x20;
* The tunnel will be drilled by an autonomous drilling machine that drills up through the rock of the mountain. Drilling is simply a matter of energy transfer, the most suitable technology for this is a spinning high-pressure water-jet boring machine that slices through the rock. The machine will grind some of the rock it chews into a carnet to use as abrasive in the cutting fluid.
* The rock waste is left to fall back down the tunnel to be excavated out.&#x20;
* The boring machine whilst delivering also lays its outer wall, either as pre-fab wall chunks, or cast in-situ using some of the local aggregate with a binding agent.&#x20;
* The tunnels will generate so much revenue for their local GDP, that the initial campaign to launch and approve for the tunnel is merely a lobbying issue. The Decels may block progress, so care should be taken to manoeuvre around them.
* The most suitable area for these tunnels is the Himalayas (Mt Everest is 28k Feet) since they are already orientated East-West and there are actually many locations that are suitable across the range.&#x20;
* There will obviously be a lot of pushback from the Decels, but it must be done. \

* The go-to market will likely be to hire a crack-team of engineers to build a 100m, then 1km, then 10km test tunnel, each time increasing the input parameters by a factor of ten.&#x20;
* The iteration towards the final goal of Mach 20, 80km is a pathway of iteration.&#x20;
* All the technology required to complete this tunnel already exists. There are some material science concerns and energy transfer problems, but they can be solved.&#x20;
* The fact that this tunnel can exist today, is wild that it hasn’t been done so far. Why not?
* With future advancements in material science and energy transfer mechanisms, the tunnels will only get more capable.&#x20;
