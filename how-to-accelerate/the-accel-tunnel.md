# The ACCEL Tunnel

One fundamental requirement of accelerationism is the transfer of vast amounts of memetic and genetic information into orbit, driven by three primary motives. Firstly, to expand our intelligence beyond Earth, we need a method to physically launch intelligence and the resources necessary to support life on other planets and stars. Secondly, as we evolve alongside and perhaps integrate more closely with silicon machines, our dependency on Earth diminishes—our home planet, while crucial to our historical development, is not essential for our future in space. Lastly, confining silicon machines to Earth poses substantial risks due to their potential to misalign with human needs and consume resources excessively. Launching them into orbit becomes a safety imperative for both humanity and our biological brethren.

Addressing these needs requires a highly reusable launch system, fundamentally different from traditional rockets due to the inefficiencies and physical limitations they present. Rockets, which carry their own fuel, expend massive amounts of energy—typically, only 1% of a rocket's weight is payload. Alternative methods such as rail guns, although powerful, are unsuitable for biological payloads due to excessive acceleration forces and wear on the system.

The proposed solution is a kinetic launch system utilizing a coil gun mechanism within a vacuumed tunnel. This system would ideally be built into one of the world's high-altitude mountains, where thinner air at 25,000 feet reduces atmospheric drag, simplifying the launch process. The tunnel, approximately 80km long, would accelerate payloads to at least Mach 20 using a smooth acceleration curve that spans 10 seconds, making it survivable for biological payloads. Upon exiting the tunnel, an ablative nose shield would protect the payload from the intense energy transfer and atmospheric re-entry forces.

This coil gun system would operate in a vacuum-sealed tunnel, maintained by continuous vacuum pumps and use a plasma shield at the tunnel's exit to seal the vacuum effectively. The expected operational cost for this system would be around $1 per kg to orbit, marking a 1000x cost reduction compared to traditional rocket launches. The tunnel would feature dual EMF fields; one for centering the payload to prevent contact with the tunnel walls, and another pulsing along the tunnel to propel the payload. The payload would have magnets at both ends to enhance the effect of the EMF fields.

Considering the potential local economic benefits, the main challenge lies in gaining approval and navigating around opposition from the Decels who may resist such an idea. The most suitable location for such a tunnel is the Himalayas, given their east-west orientation and the height required for optimal launch conditions.

The plan is to progressively build this tunnel, starting with smaller segments—a 100m prototype, followed by 1km and then 10km sections, each increasing the engineering complexity by a factor of ten. This iterative development aims to refine the technology to achieve the final goal of launching payloads at Mach 20 over an 80km distance.

Given that the necessary technology already exists, the real challenges lie in material science and energy transfer optimizations, which are solvable with targeted research and development. The feasibility of such a tunnel today, coupled with potential future advancements in related technologies, makes it a compelling project not just for accelerating human capabilities but for fundamentally reshaping our approach to space exploration and resource management.
