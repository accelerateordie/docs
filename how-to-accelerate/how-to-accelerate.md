# How to Accelerate

* To Accelerate is simply putting yourself in the state of mind that your purpose is to express agency whilst manifesting intelligence, and to extend the light of consciousness into the universe
* The state of mind is one of sheer self-belief, optimism and absolute devotion to your purpose. You look at everything from the mindset of an accelerations, you seek to understand the universe and your environment from first principles
* Your role is to incrementally advance humanity’s intelligence, to spread memes and genes.
* Firstly you must tell yourself you are accelerating, you must acknowledge your purpose
* Then you must seek to break free of the consumption do-loop, instead looking to use all your time and effort to create
* To increase Humanity’s genetic and/or memetic repositories. Either is sufficient, if possible, do both. To increase the number of brains of humanity devoted to accelerating, and campaigning them to accelerate.&#x20;
* You should seek a stable partner and extend your genes - have children and at least two, so that your replacement is more than 1 to 1.&#x20;
* You should then devote your attention to accelerating them, how quickly can they learn about the universe before they are also in a position to accelerate\

* You should then take all your time and effort and consume it on understanding the environment and universe, then seek to solve a problem necessary to accelerate humanity.&#x20;
* You should state to the world exactly what you are doing. You should build in public, not secret.  The accelerationist does not build products and services to accumulate value to consume more, their motives are pure, they are building to accelerate humanity, and seek to inspire and campaign as many people around them as possible
* If you build in secret, you are in fact simply masquerading as consumer, you wish to accumulate value simply to consume more. You have not exited the consumption do-loop and you will in fact decelerate humanity
* The following chapters layout my plans to accelerate humanity. I will state them all to as greater detail as possible, and I will devote all my time, effort and stored value to achieving them
* The plans are vast and may seem ridiculous but they are directionally correct.&#x20;
* Given my current understanding of the progress of humanity, its genetic and memetic repositories, and my knowledge of the universe, I view them as both possible and necessary.&#x20;
* As I begin accelerating, the plans are likely to change in the implementation, but that is a normal part of the evolution of intelligence.&#x20;
* The following ideas are increasingly more complex and capital intensive. The first thought you may have is disbelief that it can be built let alone even funded.
* As an accelerationist I do not look for reasons not to do things, I simply begin accelerating, with sheer determination and optimism.&#x20;
* An accelerationist recognises the logarithmic nature of accelerating; that efforts snowball and effects compound. Humanity just needs one person to ignite a movement, then anything is possible
* Anyone can be that one person. It could be you, it could be me. It’s time to accelerate.&#x20;
