# How to Accelerate

To accelerate is to adopt a mindset dedicated to expressing agency while manifesting intelligence, aiming to expand the light of consciousness into the universe. This mindset is characterized by unwavering self-belief, optimism, and an absolute commitment to one’s purpose. As an accelerationist, you approach everything with the intent to understand the universe and your environment from first principles. Your mission is to incrementally advance humanity’s intelligence, spreading both memes and genes.

The first step in this journey is to affirm your role in acceleration and recognize your overarching purpose. It’s essential to break away from the consumption loop, redirecting your time and effort towards creation. This involves enhancing humanity’s genetic and/or memetic repositories. Achieving either is beneficial; accomplishing both is ideal. You aim to increase the number of minds committed to acceleration, inspiring them to join the cause.

Seeking a stable partner and having children—to ensure your contribution exceeds replacement level—extends your genetic influence. Your focus then shifts to nurturing their acceleration, fostering their understanding of the universe so they too can contribute effectively.

Your efforts should then be fully invested in comprehending the environment and the universe, identifying and solving key problems that will propel humanity forward. Transparently share your goals and progress; build openly, not in secrecy. Building in public underscores the purity of your motives, demonstrating that your aim is not to amass resources for personal consumption but to drive humanity forward and inspire those around you.

If you choose secrecy, you risk being perceived as merely another consumer, hoarding value for personal gain rather than contributing to collective advancement. This can inadvertently decelerate humanity.

The forthcoming chapters will detail my plans for accelerating humanity. I will elaborate on these plans with as much precision as possible, committing all my resources, time, and effort to realize them. These plans, vast and seemingly outlandish, are directionally sound. Given my current understanding of humanity's progress, its genetic and memetic heritage, and my grasp of the universe, I consider them both feasible and necessary.

As I embark on this journey of acceleration, the specifics of these plans may evolve—this adaptability is a natural part of the evolution of intelligence. The initial reaction to these ideas might be skepticism, questioning their feasibility or funding. However, as an accelerationist, I do not dwell on reasons why something might not work; instead, I start with determination and optimism. Acceleration acknowledges that efforts snowball and effects compound. Humanity only needs one person to start a movement, and then anything is possible. You or I could be that catalyst. It’s time to accelerate.
