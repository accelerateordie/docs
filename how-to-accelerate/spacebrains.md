# SpaceBrains

Humans interpret their surroundings using sensory inputs: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. This sensory data helps us understand our environment and enhances our repository of memetic knowledge. Our intelligence is primarily orchestrated through our central control systems—our brains and central nervous systems. Throughout human history, our physical bodies have facilitated our interaction with the world, allowing us to move and expose our brains to varied stimuli while also providing essential protection and support.

Despite advances in modern medicine, human lifespan typically caps just shy of 100 years, with the body often failing before the brain. While current longevity research focuses on prolonging the life of the body, true longevity—potentially extending life beyond 200 years—may only be achievable by shedding our greatest limiter - the body itself.

### Implementation

The brain is surgically removed from its biological confines and housed in a pod. This pod would supply the brain with a precisely controlled mix of synthesized glucose, salt, and oxygen, powered by a fail-safe energy source like solar panels or a small-form fusion reactor.

In this setup, the brain’s spinal cord could be integrated into a sophisticated sensor field capable of interfacing directly with neurons, potentially connecting the brain to billions of devices and sensors. While retaining essential senses like sight and hearing, other senses could be remapped or enhanced—like expanding the perceptual range of electromagnetic fields or enhancing microscopic and macroscopic vision.

Connected through read-write channels and safeguarded by firewalls, including synthetic barriers to prevent malicious data intrusions, individuals could experience and interact with the world on an unprecedented scale. They would communicate not just with each other but directly with machines, transcending traditional physical limitations and operating at the speed of thought.

The pod will likely be launched into orbit where it is much more stable and consistent. The pod would be gold or lead plated to protect the brain from ionising radiation. The pod would be connected to other pods via laser-links to transmit and relay communications. In space the speed of information transfer would be much more rapid, reliable and effective.

### Why Space

The most suitable location for SpaceBrains is in orbit - where stability, consistency and protection from the elements can be achieved. The means to reach orbit is via the ACCEL Launch System; so it must be designed within the envelope of biological survivability. The human brain is likely easily able to survive 30G for the 10-15 seconds required to reach orbit; potentially much higher with suitable enclosures.&#x20;

Orbiting in space gives SpaceBrains the opportunity to access vast easily-available resources from the Sun (via solar panels), as well as direct laser-link connectivity for communication with other SpaceBrains and Bots with little impedance.&#x20;

In addition, SpaceBrains will likely need to leave Earth for their own protection - they will survive significantly longer than their earth-bound peers and thus must ensure their energy supplies and location is protection from unnecessary conflict and adversity.&#x20;

### The Transition

SpaceBrains is not just a fanciful idea - it will be necessary to preserve the great minds and their deep memetic understanding of the universe so they can have a greater impact to humanity. If you do not elect to transition to SpaceBrains - you will die on earth much younger and with less potential. Thus over time everyone will naturally transition.&#x20;

The correct time to transition is once you have finished contributing to humanity's genetic repository (procreate). This age is around 30-40 years old. The younger you transition, the longer your brain can be nurtured in a much less hostile environment with far less toxins being exposed over the lifetime of the brain. Thus the longer you will live. Waiting until your deathbed may only yield an extra 10-20 years of life; transitioning at 30 may help you achieve 200+ years of age and more.&#x20;

Indeed, once transitioned, SpaceBrains only compete in the arena of intelligence. Their body shed; all forms of prejudice is neutralised .Those that can contribute meaningfully build up the most diverse network around them. Those that don't contribute will likely be much smaller and less-network nodes in the network. Thus the ultimate reward for output and intelligence is the network formed around you voluntarily.&#x20;

### Staying competitive with the Bots&#x20;

Ultimately, SpaceBrains could serve as intermediaries between silicon machines and the remaining biological entities, ensuring the coexistence and mutual benefit of both. As pioneers of a new frontier, they would embody the accelerationist vision—drastically increasing the effectiveness, output, and longevity of human intelligence.&#x20;

SpaceBrains would still be able to accrue value by delegating thought and agency to bots anywhere in the universe. The bots would relay sensory information back to the SpaceBrains, allowing the SpaceBrain to virtually teleport anywhere in the universe at any time. SpaceBrains would instruct the machines to build, and those machines could be unlimited in scale and quantity.&#x20;

This transformation would not only allow for a radical expansion of cognitive capabilities but also position humans to keep pace with rapidly advancing silicon machines. These enhanced individuals, or "SpaceBrains," would be instrumental in solving complex challenges like exporting and managing Earth’s memetic and genetic repositories on Mars, and potentially terraforming it using synthetic resources.
