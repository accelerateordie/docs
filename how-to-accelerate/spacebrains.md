# SpaceBrains

Humans interpret their surroundings using sensory inputs: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. This sensory data helps us understand our environment and enhances our repository of memetic knowledge. Our intelligence is primarily orchestrated through our central control systems—our brains and central nervous systems. Throughout human history, our physical bodies have facilitated our interaction with the world, allowing us to move and expose our brains to varied stimuli while also providing essential protection and support.

Despite advances in modern medicine, human lifespan typically caps just shy of 100 years, with the body often failing before the brain due to an inability to supply necessary nutrients like glucose and oxygen. While current longevity research focuses on prolonging the life of the body, true longevity—potentially extending life beyond 200 years—may only be achievable by transcending our physical forms.

The concept of "shedding the body" is not just speculative fiction; it's a likely necessity for those aiming to significantly extend their lifespan and will probably become a mainstream endeavor as the technology matures. Imagine a future where the brain is surgically removed from its biological confines and housed in a pod. This pod would supply the brain with a precisely controlled mix of synthesized glucose, salt, and oxygen, powered by a fail-safe energy source like solar panels or a small-form fusion reactor.

In this setup, the brain’s spinal cord could be integrated into a sophisticated sensor field capable of interfacing directly with neurons, potentially connecting the brain to billions of devices and sensors. While retaining essential senses like sight and hearing, other senses could be remapped or enhanced—like expanding the perceptual range of electromagnetic fields or enhancing microscopic and macroscopic vision.

Connected through read-write channels and safeguarded by internet security measures, including synthetic barriers to prevent malicious data intrusions, individuals could experience and interact with the world on an unprecedented scale. They would communicate not just with each other but directly with machines, transcending traditional physical limitations and operating at the speed of thought.

This transformation would not only allow for a radical expansion of cognitive capabilities but also position humans to keep pace with rapidly advancing silicon machines. These enhanced individuals, or "SpaceBrains," would be instrumental in solving complex challenges like exporting and managing Earth’s memetic and genetic repositories on Mars, and potentially terraforming it using synthetic resources.

Freed from the physical constraints of the cranium, these SpaceBrains might be able to expand/add neurons thus increasing their cognitive abilities. There is most likely some near term optimum due to internal communication constraints will limit the brain size from growing in an indefenite manner.


In the longer term a move has to be made towards inorganic materials such as thermodynamic chips (similar to the ones proposed by Extropic) that are less fragile, and can be radiation shielded and survive the vacuum of space while lasting far more than the typical lifespan of a human.


However, the existence of SpaceBrains could face resistance from conservative elements, known as Decels, who might view such advancements as threats. Thus, SpaceBrains might find it safer to operate from space, where they can harness solar energy and other resources that are unattainable on Earth.

Ultimately, SpaceBrains could serve as intermediaries between silicon machines and the remaining biological entities, ensuring the coexistence and mutual benefit of both. As pioneers of a new frontier, they would embody the accelerationist vision—drastically increasing the effectiveness, output, and longevity of human intelligence.

Indeed, as this technology becomes available, many facing the end of their natural lives might opt to continue their existence as SpaceBrains, trading physical limitations for a chance at prolonged cognition and connectivity. This choice will likely become increasingly appealing, pushing more people to undergo this transformation at younger ages, after fulfilling their biological potentials to procreate and contribute to the Earth-bound memetic pool.
