# SpaceBrains

* Humans perceive their environment by observing it through their sensors, being sight, sound, touch, taste and smell.&#x20;
* This observation allows them to gain an understanding of their environment and increase the memetic repository of knowledge.
* Primarily we orchestrate our intelligence through our loci of control - our brains and central nervous system.&#x20;
* In the humanitarian progression to date we gained agency through our bodies. Our bodies serve to walk, run, fly our loci of control around and expose it to different stimulations.&#x20;
* Our bodies also protect and keep us alive - the entire set of organs and musco-skeleton system we carry around exists to stimulate and protect our brains.&#x20;

\


* We typically die just before 100 years old even with modern medicine, although that average age has increased over the last several hundred years.&#x20;
* Aging affects the body far more than the brain. The body typically fails the brain first, and we typically die of suffocation; our aging body is unable to deliver to our brains the necessary glucose and oxygen and we die.&#x20;
* Current longevity studies seem focussed on extending the life of the body, and they will like succeed but only marginally.&#x20;
* True longevity will be achieved, which is living out to 200 years and beyond, only if we take a drastic step - shed the body.&#x20;

\


* Shedding the body is not just a science fiction, it is actually not just a nice to have for those wanting to live longer. It will actually be necessary and likely the vast majority of the accelerating humanity will enter the program once it matures.&#x20;

\


* Putting aside the medical advancements necessary to do such a program, entertain the following idea
* The brain is surgically removed from its skeleton and placed in a pod. The pod delivers to the brain a carefully controlled supply of synthesised glucose, salt and oxygen.&#x20;
* These resources are synthesised by the pod, powered by a redundant energy source (solar panels or small-form fusion reactor)
* The brain’s spinal cord is then remapped onto a sensor field, which is able to conduct read-write of analogue electric signals with the neurones. The spinal cord has 1billion neurones, so theoretically the brain can be attached to 1bn extra devices and sensors. The spinal cord may not even be necessary to fuse silicon to; it could fuse directly into the brain’s cortex, such as what nuerallink is doing.&#x20;
* The brain has full access to its sensors, (it retains its eyes) and the sound input is retained. Some sensors can be remapped (touch and taste). Other new sensors can be added, such as perceiving a wide spectrum of the EMF field, or sensing visual fields of far greater micro or macro.&#x20;
* The brain is connected via read-write channels and the internet. Safety circuits are added, probably to the eyes, to prevent malicious injections incoming from the internet. A synthetic brain barrier as a last form of defence.&#x20;
* The individual will have full access to express agency and sense the world. They will be far more capable to be intelligent since so much extra bandwidth is unlocked by removing the burden of the skeleton. Their input/output channels will not be limited by the speed of typing or speech, rather the speed of thought.&#x20;
* They will directly communicate with each other and the machines. They will be able to transport their agency instantly to anywhere within a speed of light bubble of a latency threshold they can tolerate. Likely 1-2 seconds. So their area of delegated agency goes from a 1m bubble to a 300,000km bubble.&#x20;
* Being a far more capable being, they will be able to learn much faster and express a huge magnitude of more agency.&#x20;

\


* Since their brains are a stable organ that, under the right controlled environment, can surpass beyond 100 years, perhaps 200+ years, they will spend more of their lives expressing agency and understanding the universe.&#x20;
* Thus they will be on a compounding intelligence curve. This will allow them to stay on pace with the silicon machines and interact with them.&#x20;
* SpaceBrains, interacting and delegating agency to bots, will likely be the individuals that solve the problems of exporting memetic and genetic repositories to Mars and terraforming it with synthetic resources.&#x20;
* SpaceBrains will likely as well be the individuals that import that technology back to Earth and provide for the remaining biological machines in huge abundance. Turning the Earth in a giant reserve of co-existing humanity on scales far in-excess of today.&#x20;
* The SpaceBrains, being Accels, will be the interim guardians of humanity, since their capabilities, knowledge and speed of thought will far exceed anything humanity has seen before.&#x20;

\


* The SpaceBrains will be under threat on Earth, since the Decels will try to exterminate them, since they fear what they cannot control.&#x20;
* Thus SpaceBrains will in fact launch themselves in space, and not on Earth, where they have the protection of Space itself. Their pods will unfurl solar panels and they will intercept energy transmissions that will never have reached Earth.&#x20;
* They can be abundant, protected and proliferate space.&#x20;

\


* SpaceBrains will be the individuals that will mediate between the Silicon Machines and the Biological Machines
* They will be able to converse at high data-rates with the machines and work with them for some time
* The SpaceBrains, being biological machines at birth, will have the Biological Machine’s best interests at heart, thus are necessary to protect and keep the two Machine paradigms co-existing.&#x20;

\


* But really?
* Yes really, if this technology exists (which it will), and on your deathbed you are given one last choice. Become a SpaceBrain (the cost of which is giving up your worldly assets), and in return secure another 10-100 years of existence, stimulation, thought and connectivity. You will do it. If you don’t, you die.&#x20;
* So eventually everyone will do it, because those that don’t will die.&#x20;
* In addition, the earlier you do this procedure, the longer you live as a SpaceBrain (because even the brain slowly atrophies). Thus the age at which people elect for the transition will slowly reduce.&#x20;
* The age to do this transition is most suitable after the age of 30. Prior to 30 the earth-bound humans should accelerate their memetic uptakes, and procreate as much as possible. At least 2 kids, obviously more is better.&#x20;
* Once you make the transition, your ability to genetically proliferate is removed, but your ability to memetically proliferate begins. Thus humanity can achieve both, and in large scale.&#x20;

1. Increase the number of brains
2. Increase the effectiveness of those brains
3. Increase the output of those brains

This is the fundamental view of the Accelerationist.&#x20;
