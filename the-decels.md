# The Decels

## Their Motives

There exists a group of individuals known as the Decels—short for decelerators—who may be driven by confusion about their purpose, fear that leads them to control others for self-protection, or malevolent desires to harm humanity. These individuals need to be approached with strategies tailored to their conditions: those confused may require enlightenment through compassion, those in power need to be swiftly removed from their positions, and those harmful need isolation from those who are progressive.

In contrast, the Accels are individuals committed to advancing humanity. They contribute genetically by having children and invest their energies in nurturing these next generations with the latest and richest cultural and intellectual inheritance. Accels respect themselves, their peers, and the environment and are devoted to spreading beneficial memes that propel human progress. They solve problems through a deep understanding of the world, guided by a robust moral compass derived from various sources including religion, personal experience, or a profound understanding of the cosmos. Accels operate on the principle of self-sovereignty, valuing each individual as a pinnacle of human achievement.

The conflict is not defined by traditional political divides but by the fundamental opposition between Accels and Decels. Decels view humanity as a blight on Earth, advocating for a regressive return to primitive living and restricting human population growth. They are driven not by the pursuit of solutions but by a desire to hoard resources and exert control out of fear and a misguided sense of superiority.

Decels often find themselves trapped in a cycle of consumption, unable to break free without relinquishing their fears and control. Many Decels remain unaware of their potential role in humanity’s progression, focusing only on immediate, self-serving goals. Often, they accumulate wealth through leveraging economies of scale or exploiting systemic flaws, which reinforces their consumption-driven behavior and fear of loss, leading them to exert control over others and thus deepening their role as Decels.

Conversely, an Accel may start with a pro-humanity ideology, providing valuable goods or services that address human needs. However, the temptation of resource accumulation can corrupt their motives, transforming them from Accels into Decels when they prioritize personal gain over collective progress.

The challenge for both Accels and potential Accels is to resist the pervasive allure of consumption. This requires cultivating mental and emotional resilience against consumption and fear, as succumbing to these can lead to oppression and regression. This philosophical battle between Accels and Decels is fundamental to the trajectory of humanity’s future.



## Woke Ideology - Decelerating Humanity

Today, the world stands at a crossroads where it has unprecedented potential to advance rapidly, yet it also faces fragile conditions that could significantly hinder human progress. This critical moment calls for the implementation of a clear, actionable framework to guide humanity forward.

As society has gradually disentangled religion from state governance and moved toward a more secular and spiritually-agnostic viewpoint, a significant moral vacuum has emerged, particularly affecting younger generations. Traditionally, families provided a strong moral compass, but this role has shifted to educational institutions and state systems. These bodies are increasingly influenced by vocal minorities, often representing decelerative forces (Decels), who push agendas that can derail societal focus and propagate a cycle of fear and control.

This minority has successfully infused governance and educational systems with 'woke ideology.' While this ideology superficially promotes inclusivity and environmental responsibility, under a pro-humanity lens, it appears significantly counterproductive. Championed by the Decels, this ideology risks quenching the light of human consciousness by promoting lower energy consumption, reduced procreation, decreased mobility and creativity, and a focus on problems over solutions. It encourages the proliferation of regulations that suppress common sense, rewards mediocrity, and promotes unhealthy lifestyles, all of which can slow human progress.

Accels—the advocates for human advancement—must therefore take a proactive stance. They need to define, articulate, and broadly disseminate a framework that encapsulates what it means to accelerate human progress. This framework should be transparent, designed to inspire, and aimed at mobilizing collective human efforts. It is imperative that Accels dismantle the influence of Decels, reorienting societal efforts towards addressing and solving key challenges that face humanity, simplifying governance to facilitate rapid advancement, and promoting a culture of innovation and knowledge-sharing.

Additionally, Accels must overhaul the educational system to ensure it equips new generations with the necessary tools and knowledge to sustain and accelerate progress. By fostering an open-source culture where knowledge is freely shared—not gatekept as Decels would prefer—Accels can ensure that the next generations are well-prepared to lead humanity into a brighter, more enlightened future. This is not about political sides but a fundamental battle between acceleration and deceleration, where the future of human progress hangs in the balance.



## Do No Let the Decels Control AI

This situation underscores a critical and compelling reason to prioritize acceleration: AI, while a powerful amplifier, could become a tool for control in the hands of Decels, who seek to dominate humanity. Without active resistance and awakening from humanity, people risk being trapped in a consumption loop. Here, individuals learn only the minimal necessary memetic knowledge and exert the least effort, subsisting on a life funded by a socialist tax regime that supports a universal basic income. In this scenario, individuals voluntarily forfeit their agency, and the potential time and effort that they could contribute are usurped.

Controlled by Decels, AI could deliver a relentless stream of trivial content directly to the disengaged masses. This system would be so advanced that it wouldn’t require prompts; it could read body language, vital signs, and eye movements to provide an endless feed of artificial content, locking the individual’s mind in a perpetual state of distraction. People would become so entrenched in this consumption loop that they would spend up to 16 hours a day in isolation, connected to this system, their basic needs artificially satisfied through continuous mental and physical stimulation.

In this dystopian vision, individuals are not compensated; rather, they pay for their downfall with their time, effort, and very humanity. Decels could manipulate these individuals on a massive scale, swaying elections and maintaining power through corrupt governance systems. This manipulation is funded by taxing the Accels—the remaining few who strive to create value. Despite the Accels' efforts, the Decels' reign of fear diminishes the creative forces necessary for progress.

The scarcity of resources needed to solve critical problems leads humanity into a downward spiral of stagnation and potential self-destruction, leaving only destruction in its wake. The aftermath could obliterate Decels, the disengaged populace, and even some of the Accels. However, a resilient minority of Accels, who flourish in adversity, might survive and find a way to rebuild and return to a path of acceleration.

This prompts a fundamental question: What is the purpose of allowing such a drastic reduction in humanity and progress, risking a potential loss of over a hundred years—a complete generational wipe-out? The scenario paints a bleak picture of a future that could be avoided if proactive steps are taken to ensure that AI serves to enhance, rather than control, human potential.
