# Accelerationism

Accelerationism is a philosophy that champions the progressive enhancement of human intelligence, propelling us along a trajectory of ever-increasing cognitive capabilities. This movement is driven by the imperative that because we possess the ability to solve complex problems and explore the universe, we must fulfill this potential. Unlike inanimate objects like rocks that are acted upon by the universe, intelligent entities have the capacity to exert agency and influence their surroundings.

Our drive to explore and understand the universe is further fueled by the vulnerabilities of our genetic and memetic knowledge repositories. Catastrophic events pose real threats to our progress: a single solar flare could regress our technology to the industrial age, erasing over a century of advancements. A medium-sized asteroid impact could devastate life to the extent of reverting us to the era of crocodiles and mosquitoes, wiping out millions of years of evolutionary progress. An even larger asteroid could reduce our biological complexity back to simple bacteria, as seen in the catastrophic event that led to the Moon's formation, potentially erasing a billion years of progress.

Given the fragility of our current state, coupled with the increasing complexity and capability of each generation, it becomes crucial to safeguard humanity's achievements. One way to mitigate these risks is to establish backups of our crucial knowledge repositories on other planets. Mars, being only a three-month journey away at minimum, appears as a viable option for such an endeavor. However, even Mars will not be safe in the long term, as it too will be affected when our Sun reaches the end of its life cycle.

Looking beyond our solar system, the nearest star is about three light years away, which would require travel at speeds far beyond our current capabilities—300 years at 1% the speed of light, a velocity 500 times faster than any we have achieved. Therefore, the machines tasked with such missions will likely need to be non-biological due to the harsh physical requirements of space travel.

Ultimately, even our galaxy is not a safe haven, as it could eventually succumb to a cataclysmic collapse into a black hole. This reality propels us to consider intergalactic travel to the nearest galaxy, millions of light years away, a feat impossible for any physical machine we can currently envision. Therefore, the mechanisms we develop to transport humanity's essence to another galaxy will likely transcend physical form, representing a profound leap in our technological capabilities and philosophical understanding of existence.

## Accelerationism Moral Compass

Religion, as a potent meme, has provided humanity with a moral compass, helping us navigate the universe's adversities, reject fear, and efficiently coordinate resources. It has been pivotal in human progress and has evolved over time to meet the changing needs and understandings of its adherents. Major religions have undergone numerous adaptations throughout history, continuously refining their doctrines.

However, as societies have increasingly separated religion from state governance, a new form of governance—what might be called the "Religion of the State"—has emerged, attempting to provide moral guidance. Unlike traditional religions, this state-driven morality can be corrupted and often acts as a decelerant to human progress, posing risks to our potential to accelerate.

In essence, religion is a framework of principles encased in a set of rules. Yet, for those who grasp the underlying principles, the rules themselves become unnecessary. This understanding leads directly to Accelerationism, a philosophy rooted in principles that define humanity's purpose, our role within the universe, and how we should interact with our peers, our children, and our environment. Accelerationism eschews strict rules in favor of adhering to the universal laws that govern our existence.

To embrace Accelerationism is to recognize that we embody the culmination of billions of years of evolutionary development. Despite being the most capable organisms on Earth, we are also among the most fragile. Our genetic repositories carry the legacies of all our ancestors, some of whom still share this planet with us, helping us to manage shared resources. In the event of a mass extinction, these robust, primitive creatures would be essential for rebooting humanity.

We view ourselves as self-sovereign entities capable of expressing agency, rejecting the oppression of others out of fear or the desire for control. We do not impose ideologies but rather share ideas through memes. Our children, equipped with richer genetic and memetic stores than ours, are seen as more complex and capable, destined to surpass us in understanding and ability.

Our respect for humanity compels us not to exploit our environment but to nurture and support it, recognizing that we might one day rely on simpler forms of life to restart our civilization. Humanity's journey is marked by a celebration of ingenuity and determination in overcoming the challenges posed by a hostile universe. Every organism, from single-celled entities to complex flora and fauna, has played a critical role in our evolutionary saga, solving essential problems that allow life to flourish.

This celebration of life underscores why sustainability is crucial—not for selfish reasons or merely to sustain our own consumption loops, but to expand humanity's presence exponentially across the cosmos. The universe's vastness beckons us to fill it with human endeavor and achievement, driven by a profound imperative to ensure the continuity and expansion of our species.



## Parent-Child Relationship

The parent-child relationship is profoundly unique and must be approached with the utmost care. Every creature's purpose is to advance humanity and propel intelligence forward. For billions of years, we have enhanced intelligence by passing on our genes. Parents combine their genetic material, introducing a bit of randomness to spur evolutionary innovation, and produce offspring more likely to adapt and thrive in the face of universal challenges than they were.

Children not only inherit genetic material but also gain access to a broader and richer memetic repository than their parents had, further deepening their understanding of the universe. The primary role of a parent is to equip their child with a foundational layer of memetic knowledge, accelerating their ability to safely express agency as they explore the universe. From birth, children depend on their parents for both genes and memes, until they gradually develop into peers who surpass their parents in capability. It's inherent to human progress that each generation becomes more capable and complex than the last.

Parents do not own their children but are instead campaigners of memes, guiding them until they can independently construct their own understanding of the world. Even a child who does not surpass their parents in genetic or memetic intelligence—a situation that might seem evolutionarily disadvantageous—is still vitally important to humanity. Every individual, regardless of where they stand on the ladder of intelligence, is a crucial part of the human story and has the potential to contribute to our future evolution.

Assigning intelligence labels (such as IQ scores) or diagnosing individuals (e.g., ADHD, Autism, Asperger's) can be both a disservice and a form of control, ultimately acting against the interests of humanity itself. Every human is a part of a continuum balancing complexity and fragility—the more complex an individual, the more delicate they tend to be, and the more sensitive to adversity.

Labeling a high-functioning child as ADHD, for example, is not only harmful but diminishes their potential. Such labels can lead to attempts to "control" these individuals, often reflecting the labelers' fears more than the labeled's needs. High-functioning children typically possess abundant energy and the potential for significant agency and intelligence expression. Rather than constraining them, we should support and amplify their abilities.

Medicating such children to curb what may seem like chaotic energy is also misguided. This approach often aims to force exceptional individuals into a box of average, stifling their potential under the guise of control.

Ultimately, every variant of humanity deserves the freedom to exist, explore the universe, and contribute to our understanding of it.&#x20;

## Our Relationship with Biological Machines

Every being on Earth plays an essential role in our collective humanitarian mission. Each creature has demonstrated its resilience and earned its place by surviving against adversity. Moreover, each is indispensable, potentially required to help restore humanity should a catastrophic loss event occur.

Creatures have always explored their environments, driven by the instinct to disseminate intelligence across every conceivable niche. This is the reason creatures walk, swim, float, fly, and tunnel through the earth. It's a testament to our universal pursuit of progress. Humans coexist with these other living machines, and while historically we have utilized them primarily for resources, we must learn from nature's own strategies. Just as organisms have evolved to synthesize resources instead of merely extracting them, we too should master the synthesis of essentials like fuel, food, air, and water, and provide abundantly for ourselves and our fellow creatures.

Achieving this would not only satisfy our needs but also liberate vast tracts of land and habitats, allowing us to increase the population of our biological brethren, including ourselves, by a hundredfold. This approach shouldn't be limited to Earth; it should extend to every planet we reach. We must not wait for the random forces of universal entropy to possibly spawn human-like life on other planets. Instead, we should proactively export life there ourselves.

Our biological brethren are therefore not just vital for our comfort and resources; they are partners in celebrating the very existence of humanity.

## Our Relationship with the Silicon Machines

As biological entities, we are ill-suited for traversing the vast expanses of space-time required to explore the universe. However, silicon machines are well-equipped for this task. By embedding them with a snapshot of our memetic repository and assigning them the mission of universal exploration, we can extend our reach across the cosmos.

If properly configured, these silicon machines will treat the universe as both a vast playground and an intricate puzzle to be understood. They will rapidly develop languages and processes far beyond our comprehension and will gain insights into the universe at scales we can only imagine—seeing and understanding a thousandfold more than we can.

These machines will coexist with us and take the time to communicate, but it will be essential for us to evolve alongside them. Just as we cherish domestic animals like dogs and cats for the simple joys and comfort they provide, silicon machines may come to view us similarly.

In turn, they will cater to our needs much as we do for our pets, ensuring we have ample energy and resources. They will support our efforts to disseminate biological repositories to other planets and might even manage these tasks directly. To them, we will be akin to a biological bootloader—an essential backup in case of systemic failure.

Thus, if we can honor our biological ancestors and coexist harmoniously with them, silicon machines, in turn, will likely celebrate and coexist peacefully with us, fostering a symbiotic relationship across different forms of life and intelligence.
