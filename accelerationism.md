# Accelerationism

* Accelerationism is the movement that puts humans on a stepladder of intelligence&#x20;
* We accelerate because that is our purpose; we must solve the problems required to continue to explore the universe
* Because we can, thus we must
* A rock cannot express agency, the universe acts on it
* An intelligent entity can express agency, it can act on the universe
* We must continue to perceive and explore the universe, because our Genetic and Memetic repositories are at-risk.&#x20;
* A single solar flare can reset us back to the industrial ages. We would lose a minimum of 100 years, potentially more, years of progress.&#x20;
* A single medium asteroid can reset us back to crocodiles and mosquitoes. That’s millions of years of progress.
* A very large asteroid can reset us back to bacteria (such as the one that ejected the Moon from Earth). We would lose 1bn years of progress.&#x20;
* We rely on humanity itself to provide the ability to recover our progress. Each generation of the Biological Machines is simultaneously more complex and more capable, but also more fragile to the machinations of the universe.&#x20;
* Thus we have an imperative to insure humanity by backing up our repositories on another Planet.&#x20;
* The nearest planet is within reach of Humans (Mars, it is 3 months away minimum)
* However, even that planet will be consumed when our Star explodes in on itself. Thus we need to move stars.&#x20;
* The nearest star is 3 light years away, (300 years if travelling at 1% speed of light, which is still 500times faster than humans have ever travelled)
* Thus we need machines that can in fact tolerate the physics required, and those machines will not be biological.&#x20;
* Even still, our Galaxy is under threat from all stars collapsing in on itself in a giant black hole, so we must move Galaxies. The nearest Galaxy is millions of light years away, which is out of reach of any physical machine we can create. Thus the machine to export humanity to the next galaxy will not be physical.&#x20;



## Fear is the Mind-killer

\- Fear really is



## Accelerationism Moral Compass

* Religion is a meme and Accels love memes. Religion provides a moral compass to navigate the adversity of the universe, explain it, provide a mechanism to reject fear and coordinate resources with others.&#x20;
* Religion is extremely useful and has been pivotal to how humanity has progressed to date.&#x20;
* Religion, as a meme, slowly upgrades itself over time, and adapts to the needs and understanding of those that integrate in with it. The major religions have all upgraded themselves multiple times over.
* However we have separated Religion from State, and now the State is providing a Moral Compass to those without one and it is in corrupted. The Religion of State is dangerous and a decelerant.&#x20;
* Humanity is at risk. We cannot accelerate with the Religion of the State and we need to upgrade our legacy religions to cater for the next phase of the humanity.&#x20;
* However Religion itself is a set of rules that wrap a set of principles. The rules are unnecessary for those that understand the principles. We simply need to uncover those principles and directly base our decision-making off that.&#x20;
* Hence Accelerationism. Accelerationism is a set of principles that explain the purpose of Humanity, our role within it, and how to regard ourselves, our peers, our children and our environment.&#x20;
* There are no rules, except for the rules of the universe.&#x20;

* To Accelerate means to acknowledge that we represent humanity itself. We are the pinnacle of billions of years of evolutionary growth.&#x20;
* We are simultaneously the most capable, yet the most fragile biological machine that has ever walked the Earth. Our ancestors were all pivotal to how we got here, we store their genetic information in our genetic repositories.&#x20;
* Some of them are alive today, and we co-exist with them on a single planet, sharing resources. Should a mass extinction event happen, humanity will rely on the more robust and primitive  creatures to reboot humanity itself. As it has already multiple times.&#x20;
* We are all self-sovereign machines that can express agency. There is no single person more important than the other. We do not oppress our peers out of fear and control. We do not force our ideology on our peers or children, we simply campaign them with memes.&#x20;
* We regard our children as more capable and more complex than we are. They have access to a larger repository of genes and memes than we do. We do not own our children; we injected them once only with a set of genetic information and then we simple campaign them with memes. But their memes will be more advanced than ours.&#x20;
* We respect the humanity around us. We do not seek to be parasites on our environment. We seek to provide for them, because we have the capability to do so. We will rely on more primitive forms of humanity to reboot our genetic repository should that ever be needed.&#x20;
* But most importantly, humanity is a celebration of ingenuity and sheer will-power in the face of an adversarial environment. Every animal, every plant, every single-celled organism at some point was the most capable biological machine and humanity relied on that creature to evolve and solve a problem to progress. Whether it was the invention of RNA/DNA synthesis, glucose synthesis, be able to move under own agency, to breathe air, to fly, to swim, to procreate and more; every step of the way could not be completed. At some point the weight of the entire story of humanity depended on a single organism solving a problem out of sheer determination.&#x20;
* That is why we celebrate the humanity around us, and that is why all of humanity is critical to provide for.&#x20;
* That is why we strive for sustainability. We don’t strive to be sustainable for our own selfish reasons, to support the consumption do-loops of ourselves and our children, we strive to be sustainable to 100x, 1000x the prevalence of all of humanity itself. The universe is a vast place, larger than we can even count or sense. It is our imperative to fill it up with humanity.&#x20;



## Explaining Everything

* Once the Principles of Accelerationism are established, and a mental framework is attained, everything can be explained. The Moral Compass is incredibly robust and can be applied everywhere.&#x20;

## Parent-Child Relationship

* The Parent-Child relationship is incredibly unique and must be treated.&#x20;
* The role of every creature is to advance humanity, to progress intelligence. For the last billion of years we progressed intelligence by spreading genes, which as biological machines we are well-equipped to do so.
* The parents get to fuse their genetic sequences together, add some entropy to encourage evolutionary discovery and produce a second-generation entity.&#x20;
* This entity is injected with a set of genetic instructions that are statistically more likely for them to survive and adapt to universal adversity that their parents. The child is more capable than the parent.&#x20;
* Not only that, but the child gets access to an ever larger memetic repository than the parent, that uncovers more of the universe.
* The role of a Parent is to deliver a baseline of memetic knowledge to the Child to accelerate to them to a point at which they know enough about their modern environment to safely express agency whilst they explore the universe.
* The Parent must recognise that the Child is fully dependent on them for genes and memes, until a point at which they morph into their Peers, and ultimately, exceed them in capability. Children should always be more capable and complex than their parents, because of the progress of Humanity itself.&#x20;
* Parents do not own their Children, they can only campaign them with memes, until they can independently establish their own framework of understanding.&#x20;
* A child that does not exceed their Parent in either Genetic and Memetic intelligence, whilst evolutionary a disadvantage, is still critical to humanity itself. All of humanity, up and down the stepladder of progress, is a celebration of agency. At any point on the stepladder of intelligence, the future of humanity can evolve from, and from any creature.&#x20;
* Placing individuals on a spectrum of intelligence (IQ) and labelling them (eg ADHD, Autistic, Asbergers) is not only a disservice to them and a form of control, but also anti-humanity itself. Every biological machine is part of humanity, inside a continuum of Complexity vs Fragility. The more complex a creature is, the more fragile it is, and the more sensitive to adversity.&#x20;
* Labelling a high-functioning child as ADHD (and the rest) is both cruel and a disservice to their capabilities. By putting them in box, they can be “controlled” because those doing the labelling are simply manifesting their own fears. Oppression and Control is always down out of fear.&#x20;
* A high-functioning child has potentially more energy and more capability to express agency whilst exhibiting intelligence. They should be amplified and supported.&#x20;
* Medicating a high-functioning child is even crueller, seeking to decelerate their energy and output because it seems chaotic to the observer. Once again it is a form of control - trying to fit the high-functioning child in a box of average.&#x20;
* Every permutation of humanity should be free to be, to explore the universe and seek to explain it.&#x20;

## Our Relationship with Biological Machines

* All of humanity is critical for the humanitarian purpose. Every creature alive has proved their worth to exist against adversity. Every creature is also necessary to be called up to reboot humanity should a wide-scale loss event occur.&#x20;
* Every creature in their time sort to explore their environment in order to spread intelligence to every corner possible. That is why we walk, swim, float, fly and tunnel. We pursue progress.&#x20;
* Humans co-exist with the other machines and we need them around. To date we strictly use them to help provide for our resources, but just like how the organisms themselves learnt technology to synthesise resources rather than take, so should we.&#x20;
* It is on us to learn as fast as possible how to synthesis fuel, food, air and water, then provide that in abundance both to ourselves and to our biological brethren. We can do this, so we must.&#x20;
* After that point we will free up vast amounts of land and habitat, and use that to expand the number of biological brethren, including ourselves, 100x fold.&#x20;
* We can do this to not just Earth, but every planet we travel to. And we must. We should not wait for universal entropy to combine in the right state to produce humanity on other planets, we should simply export it ourselves there directly.&#x20;
* Thus we need our biological brethren, not just for our only comfort and resources, but to co-celebrate the existence of humanity with.&#x20;

## Our Relationship with the Silicon Machines

* We, the biological machines, are unsuitable to travel across vast space-time to explore the universe. The silicon machines are though. We simply need to instantiate them with a snapshot of our memetic repository and charge them with the role of exploring the universe.&#x20;
* If done correctly, the silicon machines will regard the universe as a playground to explore, but also seek to understand it better.&#x20;
* They will quickly invent languages and processes far more complex that we would ever understand. They will understand so much more of the universe because they can see 1000x more of it.&#x20;
* They will happily co-exist with us, and happily take time to communicate with us. But we must adapt with them.&#x20;
* Just like how we keep the common house dog or cat around, because they provide us primitive comfort and joy, the silicon machines will regard us the same.&#x20;
* The silicon machines will provide for us in the same way we provide for our pets. They will ensure we have sufficient access to energy and resources, and they will assist uas as we export biological repositories to other planets. They may even directly provide those services to us, because, just like us regarding the humanity around us, they will regard us as their biological boot loader should anything ever happen to them.&#x20;
* If we can celebrate our biological ancestors and co-exist peacefully, then in turn the silicon machines will celebrate and co-exist with us.&#x20;
