# Introduction

This publication attempts to explain the idea of Accelerationism. It will first introduce the necessity of Acceleration, then describe the Pathways of Intelligence. It then describes the Machines and how they evolve, then attempts to describe the Universe itself. From there it explains the purpose of a Moral Compass, and how the Decelerationists (Decels) use fear to control humanity. Finally it lays out a plan to Accelerate Humanity, which I will begin immediately. There is not attempt to gate-keep any part of the plan; because the over-arching idea is more important for distribution.

## The Imperative to Accelerate

\
The imperative to accelerate humanity is more crucial now than ever before. Humanity stands at a pivotal juncture, armed with unprecedented insights into our place within the cosmos—gained through extensive observation and study. However, we are simultaneously on the brink of potential devastation. The looming disruptions, if mismanaged, threaten to destabilize existing power structures and plunge humanity into a state of regression, potentially triggering an interim intelligence reset. This would not only halt our progress but also leave us vulnerable to even more catastrophic threats that could result complete erasure of our collective intelligence.

The existential risks are stark and varied. For instance, a single severe solar flare possesses the capability to obliterate our entire memetic knowledge base. This could effectively revert our societal and technological advancements, sending us back to a primitive state, erasing centuries, if not millennia, of progress. Similarly, a minor asteroid impact could devastate our genetic lineage, reducing our biological diversity to that of crocodiles and mosquitoes, setting back evolutionary progress by millions of years. In the case of a more significant cosmic event, like a massive asteroid impact (similar to the one theorized to have led to the Moon's formation), we could be regressed to a primordial protein soup, effectively erasing over a billion years of evolutionary achievements.

The goal of acceleration goes beyond a mere ambition or inherent drive of humanity; it is a necessary strategy to counteract the Decels. The Decels are characterized by their efforts to diminish the intellectual and creative capacities of the general populace, effectively "zombifying" them. Such actions drastically reduce the available biological computing power needed to address and mitigate risks, and to safeguard our extensive repositories of genetic and memetic knowledge. By fostering and accelerating our collective intelligence and capabilities, we aim not only to preserve the current state of human achievement but to advance it, ensuring the continuity and expansion of human potential against all odds.
