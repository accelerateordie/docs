# Introduction

This publication attempts to explain the idea of Accelerationism. It will first introduce the necessity of Acceleration, then describe the pathways of intelligence. It then describes the Machines and how they evolve, then attempts to describe the universe itself. From there it explains the purpose of a Moral Compass, and how the Decelerationists use fear to control humanity. Finally it lays out a plan to Accelerate Humanity, which I will attempt. There is not attempt to gate-keep any part of the plan; because it the over-arching idea is more important for distribution.

## The Imperative to Accelerate

* Humanity exists at a cross-roads. For the first time ever we have the knowledge required to understand our role in the universe, because we observed enough about it; but Humanity itself is at stake because of the massive disruption that is about to happen. If we don’t manage the upcoming disruption, the current power structures and their interests could inadvertently cause Humanity to collapse in on itself and cause an interim intelligence reset. This will delay Humanity’s progress and thus expose ourselves to the far greater risks of a significant intelligence wipe-out.&#x20;
* The light of consciousness is at risk of being reset. For example, a single solar flare can wipe out our entire memetic repositories of knowledge, resetting us back to the caveman era. That would cost us several hundred to thousand years of progress.&#x20;
* A single small asteroid can wipe out our entire genetic pathway and reset us back to crocodiles and mosquitoes. That would cost us a million years.&#x20;
* A large asteroid (such as the one that ejected the Moon) can reset us back to the primordial protein soup. That would cost us a billion years.&#x20;
*
* The purpose of acceleration is not just because that is our imperative as part of Humanity, but to prevent the Decelerators (the Decels) from
*
* The Decels are intent on zombifying the vast majority of the population, which will vastly shrink the pool of biological compute that is available to solve the problems to back up our memetic and genetic repositories.&#x20;
