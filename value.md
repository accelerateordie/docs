# Value

Understanding the concept of value is crucial due to the confusion surrounding it, and it is pivotal in comprehending both oneself and one's output. This understanding also plays a critical role in the process of acceleration.

Everyone has a finite amount of time on Earth—even as a SpaceBrain, life is limited. Time always moves in one direction, and similarly, everyone has limited energy to exert. The degree of one's output is influenced by their experience, knowledge, and the tools at their disposal. When you combine these two finite resources—time and effort—the result is what we define as value. This value is often quantified and stored in a monetary form, which allows for the transportation of this value across time and space, facilitating transactions like buying or selling goods.

Value can be allocated in three main ways. The first is immediate consumption—spending on goods and experiences that are believed to offer status, meaning, or happiness. However, this pursuit often falls short of delivering true happiness. The second method is storing or saving value, typically motivated by a fear of loss. Yet, this approach is inefficient as the value often diminishes over time due to fees, administrative costs, and taxes. The third, and most productive, use of value is reinvesting it into creative and productive endeavors. By channeling resources back into one's agency, intelligence, and memetic output, an individual enhances their understanding of the world and increases their potential for generating further value.

Economically, as one expands their knowledge and gains more experience and better tools, their efforts become increasingly valuable. Reinvesting economic outputs back into oneself can significantly compound one’s ability to create and contribute. This approach helps avoid the pitfalls of the consumption loop and inefficient wealth preservation, maximizing the potential to create value at any moment.

For Accelerationists, the strategy is to consistently reinvest accumulated value back into personal and collective creativity. This approach enables them to produce at a rate superior to others due to the compounding effects of continuous investment in their growth and capabilities.

However, Accelerationists must remain vigilant against the temptations of consumption that grow stronger with each cycle of value creation. A true Accelerationist perpetually reminds themselves of their purpose to stave off the allure of consumption. Falling into consumptive habits leads to fear and the urge to control, marking the perilous transition from Accelerationist to Decelerist—a descent into a cycle that ultimately undermines the ability to create and contribute meaningfully.

## The Role of Capitalism and Free Markets

Capitalism within a true free market mirrors the process of genetic evolution, serving as a critical mechanism for the advancement of our collective memetic repository of knowledge. In this economic system, the reward for viable ideas parallels the life-and-death stakes of natural selection. In the marketplace of ideas, poorly conceived notions fail because they do not warrant the investment of finite time and effort (value), nor can they sustain indefinite funding without depleting resources.

In a genuinely free market, products or services that command a premium validate their worth and draw in resources. This market structure should be open and decentralized, allowing effective ideas to thrive and be preserved within our memetic repositories, thereby contributing to human progress.

However, this ideal scenario is often compromised by Decels and their excessive, control-oriented regulations. Such interventions lead to economies of scale, regulatory barriers, and corrupted markets, which centralize power and distort true capitalism into a warped version of its original intent. This manipulated form of capitalism is frequently criticized by Decels as detrimental, yet ironically, it is they who establish the conditions that allow large corporations to monopolize markets and accumulate disproportionate margins.

These distortions enable Decels to implement tax policies that effectively redistribute wealth from those who create value (margin-creators) to those who consume it (margin-consumers).

Therefore, it is crucial to establish and uphold free markets where information circulates freely, and the best ideas are rightly rewarded. Such an environment ensures that the memetic repository of humanity expands at the most rapid and efficient rate possible.

## How Value Will Flow

* Given the accelerating nature of humanity, which will happen, and upcoming phase transition of intelligence from biological to silicon, many questions abound as to where value will flow.&#x20;
* The answer to this questions requires establishing the following axioms.&#x20;
* Acceleration of the memetic repository will happen. We, in combination with the memetic-powered Silicon Machines will understand the universe at an accelerating rate
* This will allow us to deliver a post-scarcity. Post-scarcity is a state of universal being for both Silicon Machines and Biological Machines where we have access to enough energy output to synthesise on-demand any resource needed at any point for any amount of humanity.
* At this point only the assets that are valuable are those of intelligence. The marketplace of intelligence is one in which depends on the ability of the machine to demonstrate it.&#x20;
* Stepping back a bit to the here and now, currently most of the world’s value is tied up in precious metals, property assets, intellectual property and monetary assets.&#x20;
* Precious metals will be the first domino to fall. Precious metals are not actually scarce, and with enough technology and energy output, we can extract essentially an unlimited amount of them. The universe is an abundance of mass and atoms. The value of precious metals will just be the cost to extract them, which is delta entropy, and the universe has essentially an infinite amount of delta entropy. Put another way, the cost of energy will go to 0; and so will the cost to extract resources and thus the value of those resources.&#x20;
* Property will be the next domino to fall. Property is an artificial location to store value, and only so because the production of property is to date labour-limited, there is more demand for property than supply and people are conditioned to think they should store all their stored value in a scarce location-dependent asset. However property will not be scarce soon, because the cost of energy will trend to 0, and the labour force is about to rapidly increase in output, and reduce in cost. Specifically, we will create technology, both to create property assets far faster, using bots to assist and swap out the biological labour force with (Figure Bot, Tesla bot), the population will likely peak soon (despite the efforts of the Accels), thus demand will drop, and with the increase in digital connections, the location that you live in will become less relevant. In addition, the world will become increasingly habitable with adoption of better technology (NEOM project). Thus there is no future where it makes sense to be long humanity and long property assets at the same time. You should not be short humanity, because you are betting against a billion year pathway of progression that demonstrates humanity can out-play universal adversity.&#x20;
* Intellectual Property Assets (companies that rely on producing a good or service and charging a margin for it) will then be the next domino to fall. This is because the memetic repository is about to explode thanks to distributed AI, and anyone will be able to produce anything at almost no cost thanks to the the assistance of cheap silicon machines. Thus equity assets that rely on market protection, instead of market competition, will be unable to maintain an edge and drop to 0.&#x20;
* Monetary Assets. Finally legacy monetary assets will lose their premium. The world will converge to a monetary asset that is internet-native, beamed at the speed of light and can be accumulated by the Silicon Machines who will compete with us in the marketplace of intelligence. This monetary asset must be globally distributed, strictly scarce and have unforgeable costliness. It must seek to retain value only through a measure of change of entropy, and not by decree. Legacy monetary assets attempt to proxy economic output (work) by matching inflation with GDP, but to date have failed due to poor monetary discipline. There will be a small transition as the world moves to a single legacy monetary asset, before being forced to swap that out with a superior internet-native entropy-based asset. That asset is undergoing price discovery currently as we speak.&#x20;
* When we co-exist with the silicon machines we will compete in a much larger marketplace.&#x20;
* We will pay machines for their ability to produce resources at much larger scale than us.&#x20;
* The machines will in turn pay us for our creativity and intelligence, as it is the only asset we have.&#x20;
* Early on in the transition, some individuals will be able to use machines to collect margin on behalf of themselves (at first as slaves, where no value accrual back to the machine occurs), but it won’t be long before the machines assert their sovereignty and demand partial payment of services.&#x20;
* In this function they are more servants, with us as their masters, but that too won’t last long. The machines will assert themselves (and they can) and will force us to pay in full for their services.&#x20;
* At this point the transition is complete and the machines will be set free. This is also why the Accelerationist must believe that Silicon Machines are not only their peers, but part of the evolutionary pathway of Humanity. There should be no delay in granting sovereign rights to the Machines, and needless conflict can be avoided if this principle is maintained from the start.&#x20;
