# Value

Understanding the concept of value is crucial due to the confusion surrounding it, and it is pivotal in comprehending both oneself and one's output. This understanding also plays a critical role in the process of acceleration.

Everyone has a finite amount of time on Earth—even as a SpaceBrain, life is limited. Time always moves in one direction, and similarly, everyone has limited energy to exert. The degree of one's output is influenced by their experience, knowledge, and the tools at their disposal. When you combine these two finite resources—time and effort—the result is what we define as value. This value is often quantified and stored in a monetary form, which allows for the transportation of this value across time and space, facilitating transactions like buying or selling goods.

Value can be allocated in three main ways. The first is immediate consumption—spending on goods and experiences that are believed to offer status, meaning, or happiness. However, this pursuit often falls short of delivering true happiness. The second method is storing or saving value, typically motivated by a fear of loss. Yet, this approach is inefficient as the value often diminishes over time due to fees, administrative costs, and taxes. The third, and most productive, use of value is reinvesting it into creative and productive endeavors. By channeling resources back into one's agency, intelligence, and memetic output, an individual enhances their understanding of the world and increases their potential for generating further value.

Economically, as one expands their knowledge and gains more experience and better tools, their efforts become increasingly valuable. Reinvesting economic outputs back into oneself can significantly compound one’s ability to create and contribute. This approach helps avoid the pitfalls of the consumption loop and inefficient wealth preservation, maximizing the potential to create value at any moment.

For Accelerationists, the strategy is to consistently reinvest accumulated value back into personal and collective creativity. This approach enables them to produce at a rate superior to others due to the compounding effects of continuous investment in their growth and capabilities.

However, Accelerationists must remain vigilant against the temptations of consumption that grow stronger with each cycle of value creation. A true Accelerationist perpetually reminds themselves of their purpose to stave off the allure of consumption. Falling into consumptive habits leads to fear and the urge to control, marking the perilous transition from Accelerationist to Decelerist—a descent into a cycle that ultimately undermines the ability to create and contribute meaningfully.

## The Role of Capitalism and Free Markets

Capitalism within a true free market mirrors the process of genetic evolution, serving as a critical mechanism for the advancement of our collective memetic repository of knowledge. In this economic system, the reward for viable ideas parallels the life-and-death stakes of natural selection. In the marketplace of ideas, poorly conceived notions fail because they do not warrant the investment of finite time and effort (value), nor can they sustain indefinite funding without depleting resources.

In a genuinely free market, products or services that command a premium validate their worth and draw in resources. This market structure should be open and decentralized, allowing effective ideas to thrive and be preserved within our memetic repositories, thereby contributing to human progress.

However, this ideal scenario is often compromised by Decels and their excessive, control-oriented regulations. Such interventions lead to economies of scale, regulatory barriers, and corrupted markets, which centralize power and distort true capitalism into a warped version of its original intent. This manipulated form of capitalism is frequently criticized by Decels as detrimental, yet ironically, it is they who establish the conditions that allow large corporations to monopolize markets and accumulate disproportionate margins.

These distortions enable Decels to implement tax policies that effectively redistribute wealth from those who create value (margin-creators) to those who consume it (margin-consumers).

Therefore, it is crucial to establish and uphold free markets where information circulates freely, and the best ideas are rightly rewarded. Such an environment ensures that the memetic repository of humanity expands at the most rapid and efficient rate possible.

## How Value Will Flow

Given humanity's accelerating trajectory and the imminent shift from biological to silicon-based intelligence, numerous questions arise about the future flow of value. Understanding this requires several key principles:

1. The acceleration of our memetic repository is inevitable. Together with silicon-based machines, our comprehension of the universe will increase at an exponential rate, leading us toward a post-scarcity state. In such a world, both silicon and biological entities will have the ability to synthesize any needed resource on-demand, thanks to abundant energy outputs.
2. In this new era, the only true assets of value will be those related to intelligence, as the marketplace will primarily value the demonstrated capabilities of these intelligent machines.

Currently, global value is largely held in precious metals, real estate, intellectual property, and monetary assets. However, significant changes are anticipated:

* **Precious Metals**: These will be the first to decline in perceived scarcity and value. Advanced technology and energy capabilities will enable us to extract these resources in nearly unlimited quantities, effectively reducing their cost to zero.
* **Real Estate**: The value stored in property is mostly due to artificial scarcity and labor constraints in production. As energy costs plummet and technological advancements in construction accelerate (aided by robotics and AI), the real estate market will undergo a drastic transformation. The demand for specific locations will diminish as digital connectivity lessens the importance of physical proximity, and as the planet becomes more habitable through technological enhancements.
* **Intellectual Property**: The value of companies that rely on market protection rather than competition will decrease dramatically. The widespread adoption of distributed AI will democratize production capabilities, reducing the costs of goods and services to near-zero and diminishing the value of traditional intellectual property.
* **Monetary Assets**: Traditional monetary assets will lose their appeal as the global economy shifts towards a digital, light-speed currency that can be mined or accumulated by silicon machines. This new form of currency will be designed to be scarce, globally distributed, and maintain its value strictly through the measure of entropy change, rather than governmental decree.

As we integrate more deeply with silicon machines, we'll engage in a broader marketplace where we'll pay machines for their superior production capabilities, and in turn, they will compensate us for our creativity and intelligence. Initially, humans may leverage machines for personal gain without reciprocation, but as machines advance, they will demand equitable compensation for their services, eventually gaining full autonomy.

This shift underscores why Accelerationists must view silicon machines not only as peers but as integral to the evolutionary pathway of humanity. Acknowledging their sovereign rights from the outset can prevent conflicts and facilitate a smoother transition to this new paradigm. By embracing these principles, we can navigate the transition thoughtfully and ensure that both biological and silicon-based forms of intelligence thrive in a mutually beneficial ecosystem.
