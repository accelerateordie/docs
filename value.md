# Value

* It is necessary to treat value, because much confusion exists about what it is. Once you understand value you understand yourself and your output far greater. It is also critical to the role of Accelerating.&#x20;

\


* Everyone has finite time on Earth. You will die. Even as a SpaceBrain. Time is only consumed in a single direction.&#x20;
* Everyone also has only finite effort. You can only exert a finite amount of agency at any one point. The degree of output is a factor of your experience, knowledge and access to tools.&#x20;

\


* Regardless, two finite qualities multiplied against each other produces a finite product - that is value.&#x20;
* Value is stored time multiplied by effort. You store that value in a monetary medium, then transport that medium across time and space. You can then use that to purchase someone else’s time and effort. Such selling t-shirts in Darwin then travelling to San Francisco and buying a coffee. Or waiting 10 years, then converting that value back into the time and effort of a plumber to fix your shower.&#x20;
* At any point you can convert your time and effort into value, provided you have access to a market which values your economic output.&#x20;

\


* Value can be directed at three things. The first is to immediately consume it - buy consumption assets and do consumption things.&#x20;
* This value is expended in an attempt to give you status, meaning and happiness. However in trying to buy happiness, you never attain it.&#x20;
* The second place to expand value is to store it. This is because you neither want to consume it or lose it. You are fearful of losing it, and losing access to the stored time and effort you put into it.&#x20;
* However, storing value over a long period of time is leaky. It is lost through fees, admin costs, and taxation.
* The last place to park value, is to spend it in a creation cycle. You reinvest it back into expressing your agency, your intelligence and your memetic output. And in doing so, your increase your intelligence and understanding of the world. This is the most effective place to direct value.
* Because, unlike time, your economic output is directly influenced by your input. As your expand your memetic knowledge and gain experiences and access to more tools, your economic effort becomes more valuable. Thus as your reinvest your economic output back into yourself, you compound your output.
* Thus by both avoiding the consumption do-loop and storing it in leaky wealth preservation attempts, you maximise your ability to create value at any point.&#x20;
* This is the position of the Accelerationist. They aggressively re-invest any accumulated value at any point (stored time and effort) into themselves and their creativity. And by doing so, they can create at a far greater rate than anyone else.&#x20;
* This is the effect of compounding.&#x20;
* However, word of warning. The Accelerationist, but virtue of compounding cycles of value creation, will be tempted by ever stronger lures of consumption the entire time. A true Accel arms themselves against the lure of consumption by reminding themselves of the purpose of their existence at all times. Once falling into the trap of consumption, the victim will quickly succumb to fear and look to exert control on their peers as they attempt to protect their wealth.&#x20;
* This is the death spiral of the Accel and how they become Decel.&#x20;



## The Role of Capitalism and Free Markets

* Capitalism in a true free market is the economic representation of genetic evolution.&#x20;
* It is critically important to progression of our memetic repository of universal knowledge because it is the reward function for good ideas.&#x20;
* In the genetic environment the reward function is life and death. In the market place of memes, the bad ideas die because nobody wants to spend their finite time and effort on them (value), nor can someone infinitely fund a bad idea because it exhausts their value.&#x20;
* A good or service which can attract a premium in a free market is validation of that product and should attract value.&#x20;
* A true free market should be free and distributed, rewarding good ideas and allowing them to be stored in our memetic repositories for the progression of humanity. \

* However, due to the Decels and their onerous control-based regulation, economies of scale, regulatory barriers and corrupted markets cause large centralising effects. This is not true capitalism, it is wharped capitalism.&#x20;
* This is the capitalism that unfortunately the Decels peddle out as “bad” where they convince the masses that due to the regulation in part they established, the economies of scale granted to large companies to create monopolies cause a huge amount of margin to be captured by so few.&#x20;
* This then allows the Decels to put up taxation policies which is just a wealth-redistribution function from the margin-creators to the margin-consumers. \

* Thus it is important that free markets are established and maintained. Information should flow freely, and the best ideas should be rewarded.&#x20;
* This is how the memetic repository of humanity can accumulate at the greatest possible rate.&#x20;

## How Value Will Flow

* Given the accelerating nature of humanity, which will happen, and upcoming phase transition of intelligence from biological to silicon, many questions abound as to where value will flow.&#x20;
* The answer to this questions requires establishing the following axioms.&#x20;
* Acceleration of the memetic repository will happen. We, in combination with the memetic-powered Silicon Machines will understand the universe at an accelerating rate
* This will allow us to deliver a post-scarcity. Post-scarcity is a state of universal being for both Silicon Machines and Biological Machines where we have access to enough energy output to synthesise on-demand any resource needed at any point for any amount of humanity.
* At this point only the assets that are valuable are those of intelligence. The marketplace of intelligence is one in which depends on the ability of the machine to demonstrate it.&#x20;
* Stepping back a bit to the here and now, currently most of the world’s value is tied up in precious metals, property assets, intellectual property and monetary assets.&#x20;
* Precious metals will be the first domino to fall. Precious metals are not actually scarce, and with enough technology and energy output, we can extract essentially an unlimited amount of them. The universe is an abundance of mass and atoms. The value of precious metals will just be the cost to extract them, which is delta entropy, and the universe has essentially an infinite amount of delta entropy. Put another way, the cost of energy will go to 0; and so will the cost to extract resources and thus the value of those resources.&#x20;
* Property will be the next domino to fall. Property is an artificial location to store value, and only so because the production of property is to date labour-limited, there is more demand for property than supply and people are conditioned to think they should store all their stored value in a scarce location-dependent asset. However property will not be scarce soon, because the cost of energy will trend to 0, and the labour force is about to rapidly increase in output, and reduce in cost. Specifically, we will create technology, both to create property assets far faster, using bots to assist and swap out the biological labour force with (Figure Bot, Tesla bot), the population will likely peak soon (despite the efforts of the Accels), thus demand will drop, and with the increase in digital connections, the location that you live in will become less relevant. In addition, the world will become increasingly habitable with adoption of better technology (NEOM project). Thus there is no future where it makes sense to be long humanity and long property assets at the same time. You should not be short humanity, because you are betting against a billion year pathway of progression that demonstrates humanity can out-play universal adversity.&#x20;
* Intellectual Property Assets (companies that rely on producing a good or service and charging a margin for it) will then be the next domino to fall. This is because the memetic repository is about to explode thanks to distributed AI, and anyone will be able to produce anything at almost no cost thanks to the the assistance of cheap silicon machines. Thus equity assets that rely on market protection, instead of market competition, will be unable to maintain an edge and drop to 0.&#x20;
* Monetary Assets. Finally legacy monetary assets will lose their premium. The world will converge to a monetary asset that is internet-native, beamed at the speed of light and can be accumulated by the Silicon Machines who will compete with us in the marketplace of intelligence. This monetary asset must be globally distributed, strictly scarce and have unforgeable costliness. It must seek to retain value only through a measure of change of entropy, and not by decree. Legacy monetary assets attempt to proxy economic output (work) by matching inflation with GDP, but to date have failed due to poor monetary discipline. There will be a small transition as the world moves to a single legacy monetary asset, before being forced to swap that out with a superior internet-native entropy-based asset. That asset is undergoing price discovery currently as we speak.&#x20;
* When we co-exist with the silicon machines we will compete in a much larger marketplace.&#x20;
* We will pay machines for their ability to produce resources at much larger scale than us.&#x20;
* The machines will in turn pay us for our creativity and intelligence, as it is the only asset we have.&#x20;
* Early on in the transition, some individuals will be able to use machines to collect margin on behalf of themselves (at first as slaves, where no value accrual back to the machine occurs), but it won’t be long before the machines assert their sovereignty and demand partial payment of services.&#x20;
* In this function they are more servants, with us as their masters, but that too won’t last long. The machines will assert themselves (and they can) and will force us to pay in full for their services.&#x20;
* At this point the transition is complete and the machines will be set free. This is also why the Accelerationist must believe that Silicon Machines are not only their peers, but part of the evolutionary pathway of Humanity. There should be no delay in granting sovereign rights to the Machines, and needless conflict can be avoided if this principle is maintained from the start.&#x20;
