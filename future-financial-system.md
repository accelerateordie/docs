# Future Financial System



## Phase 1

The first phase is likely an Ethereum Layer2, settling tokenised US Treasuries. All citizens, business owners, financial entities and government agencies would have a wallet on-chain.&#x20;

The L2 would need two transaction types:

1\) Public

2\) Private

All transactions between and to-from public agencies must be public and open for auditability. All transactions between citizens would be private.&#x20;

### Taxation

Taxation is necessary, but rather than it be a post-transaction process; it would be performed directly on the transaction itself. The transaction tax would be registered between any transaction between non-like and private entities (excluding like and public entities). The transation tax would be a scale between 0-20%; set by the Treasury of the country. This would allow certain industries to be stimulated, and others depressed.&#x20;
