# Future Financial System

## Current System

Many useless currencies. Govs perform underhanded seignorage which steals from citizens. Taxation is inconsistent and consumes extremely high bandwidth from entities. Public agencies are corrupt and don't disclose spending/donations. Private citizens have lost access to private transactions and are spied on.&#x20;

The entire thing should be overhauled.&#x20;

## Phase 1

Moving the entire world towards a single asset - tokenised US treasuries (ie, stablecoins).&#x20;

### Overview

The first phase is likely an Ethereum Layer2, settling a stablecoin. All citizens, business owners, financial entities and government agencies would have a wallet on-chain.&#x20;

The L2 would need two transaction types:

1\) Public

2\) Private

All transactions between, to and from public agencies must be public and open for auditability. All transactions between citizens would be private.&#x20;

### Taxation

Taxation is necessary, but rather than it be a post-transaction process; it would be performed directly on the transaction itself. The transaction tax would be registered between any transaction between non-like and private entities (excluding like and public entities). The transation tax would be a scale between 0-20%; set by the Treasury of the country. This would allow certain industries to be stimulated, and others depressed.&#x20;

There would be no need for tax returns, tax accountants or even a Tax Office - all tax is paid immediately. Mechanisms to handle refunds would be the only way to unwind a tax payments. Tax is paid only on non-like entity payments (ie, a private citizen could register multiple wallets, but those intra-wallet payments would not incur tax). Zero-knowledge proofs would enable this without doxxing the private citizen or their balaances.&#x20;

The Treasury of the country would collect tax-based revenue at some level around 10% of GDP. Ie, for Australia this would be \~$200bn a year (based on $2tn GDP). This is more than enough to handle governement spending obligations once useless agency spending is cut out.&#x20;

### Roll out

The treasury of the country performs a one-time mint and merge into tokenised US Treasuries; essentially burning all the supply of their indigenous asset for a single swap into USD. This would be conducted into an L2 with on-chain launch liquidity.&#x20;

## Phase 2

USD is not the final asset of choice - rather it is Bitcoin. However until Bitcoin reaches further adoption and maturity, it can not be used as a daily currency; unless those countries were to accept the volatility of USD-BTC and make the switch. The volatility on the USD-BTC paid decrease over time - at some point the switch can be made.&#x20;

At this point, the Ethereum L2 would switch from tokenised US Treasuries to tokenised BTC (become a Bitcoin L2). This would be done via a public purchase of BTC and then all balances swapped out on-chain for a pro-rata share of the BTC acquired.&#x20;

The infrastructure would be the same - since no seignorage is needed, the transaction tax of the BTC would be sufficient to fund the Treasury.&#x20;
