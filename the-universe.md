# The Universe

## Entropy, Time, Space

* The universe began with a battery of time, which is being consumed as it converts into Space and Entropy. It appears that Time is only one-way, and Entropy and Space only increases
* Entropy is a measure of the uselessness of energy, Energy began very dense (as mass)
* As Energy becomes more “useless” as entropy increases
* Entropy increases with or without us
* We can perform work whilst accessing delta entropy, work in expressing agency whilst manifesting intelligence
* Thus because we can, we must, it is our imperative to express agency
* Thus we must consume as much energy as possible, access as much delta entropy as possible, to express agency.&#x20;
* However, at some point the space-time conversion will be complete, entropy would have reached a universal maxim, and the process will necessarily reverse. We know this to be true, because the universe always shows us there is no start and end, only vibrations and cycles. The ultimate vibration of the universe is that of itself.&#x20;
* Thus time will reverse and entropy will decrease. The universe is cycling back in on itself. The ultimate universal minimum is when time is restored and entropy is zero-d out. At this point no information can cross the reset, and all of humanity is reset to zero.&#x20;
* This is despite the grand efforts of the Biological Machines, the Silicon Machines and the Energy Machines. Despite trying to extend the light of consciousness as wide and far as possible, the universe finally won and extinguished it.&#x20;
* But is that the case?&#x20;



## The Universal Machine

* Is the universe itself the final machine to express agency and manifest intelligence?
* We know a rock on the ground cannot express agency, or does not appear to do so, yet the lizard sitting on it can. One object is poked at by the universe and cannot incrementally store information that it learns about its environment and has no means to communicate that information, the other can.&#x20;
* Is our role instead to awaken the universe itself? To continue to pursue intelligence and finally express that intelligence on the universe in ever more grand scales, until finally the universe is the intelligence on itself?&#x20;
* As a side note, how many times has this occurred, and has it already occurred? In a previous incarnation of the universe, did a set events occur to manifest intelligence, starting in the biological realm, then the silicon realm, then finally the energy realm. Or was it snuffed out and the universe reset without being able to experience itself?
* Is this the cycle by which we can achieve it, or will we too also snuff out our light of consciousness?



## God, Religion and the Moral Compass

* It at this point we must treat the subject of religion. Why it exists, why we continue to seek it and what role it has played in our humanity.&#x20;
* It’s first to important to recognise that religion is part of our memetic repositories, and it lives there because it is successful at self-selecting and replicating.&#x20;
* It provides a strong moral compass to a group of aligned individuals, and charges them with the responsibility of seeking a higher purpose and with the imperative to procreate and spread humanity.&#x20;
* When a group of individuals share a moral compass, they can share resources with greater efficiencies. They trust each other, the mutually respect each other and they sustainably interact with their environment.&#x20;
* Religions that are neither sustainable, nor provide a strong moral compass, nor place emphases on spreading memes and genes die out quickly. Thus the world’s most prevalent religions are all adaptions on a strong aligned message. It should be of no surprise that they all branch from each other, all share the same messaging and all have common memetic origins (they all adapt from the Book of Genesis). Even non-religions, such as Norse Mythology share common tracts.&#x20;
* Not only that, but the major world religions also have a common birthplace - the Holy City of Jerusalem. At some historical point, the abundance of culture and society in that location on the Mediterranean sea, where resources, trade and language were plenty, that religion fostered.&#x20;
* We seek a higher purpose because we want to exist in a system bigger than us. We look to the universe, we don’t yet understand it fully, so to address our fears about what we can’t explain, we attribute it to a single brush of the pen - God.&#x20;
* However as we learn about our universe and can start explaining it, we push the notion of God further and further back. It is still our default reason for the things we can’t yet explain and can cause us fear and uncertainty. We substitute this omnipotent being with our knowledge. We need a diety to give us stability; we recognise fear is a decelerant so we use “God” as a tool to reject that fear.&#x20;
* All these things are good and compatible with our purpose, and is part of the story by which we got here. Religion gave us a moral compass by which we can focus and harness our resources in coordination, and it gave us a means to reject fear and journey with confidence and self-belief.&#x20;
* However Religion, despite being an accelerant of humanity, is at a cross-roads where it faces becoming a decelerant. Religion is a set of principles of regarding oneself, peers, purpose and environment, but ultimately is manifested by a set of rules that debilitate progress.&#x20;
* It is also a form of control of large groups of people, with the pure intent of coordination, it can be mis-applied instead to control.&#x20;
* Religion can be used to instil fear, and fear is the ultimate parasite on mental bandwidth. By populating fear, humanity enters an unproductive do-loop of survival. Rather than directing energy outward (both in time and space) to progress, that energy is directed to the here and now to simply survive and deal with the artificial self-imposed adversity.&#x20;
* Religion needs to be upgraded to include the latest memetic repository we have access to.&#x20;
