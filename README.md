# Foreword

This publication is a work in progress. It needs editing, researching and re-organisation. It needs to be crowd-edited and it must be open-source. It is my latest understanding of Accelerationism. Some of it could be wrong and may be changed later.&#x20;

\
This is a dangerous publication and makes no apologies. Do not read it if you don’t have an open mind to yourself and humanity itself. Fundamentally the ideas in this publication challenge every notion of humanity itself, and every aspect of society. It may threaten the current power structures of society. It may accelerate humanity, or it may fall flat and never go anywhere.&#x20;

\
Regardless, the ideas are now out in the open. Let’s see where it takes us.&#x20;
