The raw unfiltered Stream of Thought is here:

An earlier effort was made to turn the Thought Stream into cohesive paragraphs, but a lot of precision was lost. It is now being re-written. Reah the Thought Stream above to access greater precision.&#x20;

This publication is a work in progress. It needs editing, researching and re-organisation. It needs to be crowd-edited and it must be open-source. It is my latest understanding of Accelerationism. Some of it could be wrong and may be changed later.&#x20;

\
This is a dangerous publication and makes no apologies. Do not read it if you don’t have an open mind to yourself and humanity itself. Fundamentally the ideas in this publication challenge every notion of humanity itself, and every aspect of society. It may threaten the current power structures of society. It may accelerate humanity, or it may fall flat and never go anywhere.&#x20;

I wrote the substantial part of this document as a long list of ideas in one session. I then expanded out the main ideas into sections. It needs more copy-editing to make it widely accessible. I am now in the process of sourcing a book writer-publisher to get this disseminated.&#x20;

\
Regardless, the ideas are now out in the open. Let’s see where it takes us.&#x20;

I will be taking edits. Submit a PR or Issue here for me to consider. All contributions will be added as credits.
